"i actually had two separate experiences as a bbt customer one more awful than the previous several years ago i was running my own small business and being a fairly local bank with several branches in my area it seemed like a solid choice to bank with them however as my time with bbt progressed i became aware of service charges and other fees that had not been disclosed to me upfront nor when i had asked about such fees during the initial opening of my accounts they just began to appear on my accountsto make matters worse i receivedyesbank statements the entire time i was with them this was before online banking became popular no one was stealing them out of my mail i had a work po box at the time and when i asked them about why the lack of statements they made it seem like it was my fault i needed these statements to keep proper track of my books for my business and for tax purposes in a time before good online banking and they couldnt have cared less afteryears with them i closed my account and went with bofa who wasbetter at everything this long running incident couldve been overlooked on my part if not for the nd incident i incurred at the hands of bbtfast forward several years i had been with several banks for both business and personal accounts and all were pretty much the same they treated you like any bank would which is to say itswhether or not youll receive good service on any given day the cost of doing business though i took on a side job and decided to open a new bank account just for the purposes of depositing the money from this new job into this account and basically use it as a savings account and for emergency purposes etc i had heard from a few people that bbt had improved and gotten a lot better customer service had improved and they were now offering some great new services etc so reluctantly i decided to give them another try after more than a decade awayi was pleasantly surprised when i went to open my account in person at one of their new local branches and was greeted by a great team of bankers who seemed very interested in walking me through all their banking options what they offered asking me what i was looking for etc the thing that i liked the most was that the account i was going to open came with zero fees for as long as i had the account with no minimum balance and no required amount of transactions per month which was perfect for me because i basically wanted to deposit money in the account and not touch it unless it was an emergency or for an investment so i signed upfor the first couple of months things seemed to be ok no problems and no complaints however after aboutmonths i moved to colorado and informed bbt both over the phone and in writing that i was doing so but intended to leave my account open and continue to make deposits into it i informed them of my new address so that they would not flag my account if i was using my atm card outside of the traditional area and basically covered all of my bases with themwhen my car needed repairs after i got to colorado and i went to pay it my card was declined i checked my account balance and sure enough there was plenty of money to pay the bill but for some reason i couldnt run my card i called bbt and they explained they had put a hold on my account since it was being used in colorado of course i had to run back through with them that i had moved it really was me etc etc they said my account would be released immediately for use and sorry for the inconvenience the truth was that they did not fix the problem fordays and i had to use another card so i could get my car out of the shop embarrassing and a real hassle i can chalk it up to their efforts for fraud prevention but what a hassle it was to work with themhowever the real kicker came even a few months later i was still living in colorado and still had my bbt account which i was still depositing money into and using for things such as gas occasional misc expenses and emergencies i ended up in the hospital formonths having to undergo multiple surgeries and chemotherapy during this time i never touched my bbt account with no deposits or withdrawals and just a steady balance in there after finally walking out of the hospital after fighting for my life for the pastmonths i needed to pay a few misc hospital bills and decided to use my bbt account to do so since this is what the account was for in the first place the day i got out of the hospital i tried logging into my bbt account online and was denied access i tried several times thinking maybe i had just forgotten the password or something but to no availfinally i called the customer service and i use this term very loosely hotline i was greeted by a very surly gentleman who sounded like he was being bothered by even having to pick up the phone when i explained my situation to him he explained that my account had been shut down for lack of use this made no sense since i was specifically told when i signed up that there was no minimum transaction activity required for this account he then went on to gruffly explain my account had over drafted again when i explained to him that this account had no fees associated with it and i had not used the account since i was in the hospital the lastmonths he kept cutting me off saying that i had over drafted and hadnt paid the over draft fees and therefore my account had been shut downfinally after several attempts i was able to get into my old account to see all the transactions sure enough there was no activity from me but there were maintenance fees and surcharges from bbt that i had nothing to do with and had caused my account to overdraft with no warning or documentation from bbt either by mail or online nada nothing when i tried explaining my situation to the service rep again he again kept cutting me off telling me there was nothing they could do i shouldve been aware of my account etc when i offered to fax him over a copy of my account agreement that stated in black in white that no fees would ever be charged for this account and showed that i had overdraft protection on this account he flat out refused and said he was not interested in seeing any documentation i had and that the account was closed and i would have to pay the fees to have it reinstated which amounted to more thanby the wayafter trying to figure something out all so i could pay some of my hospital bills i guess he was at the end of his day and wanted to go home because he yet again cut me off and i kid you not stated well if you would just make more money and be more responsible this wouldve never happened and then proceeded to hang up on me abruptly needless to say i was blown away by the service or lack of service i received and how rudely i was treated by this bank i know im not their richest client they have but i was always a good customer of the bank during my time with them never made a fuss etc but for them to treat me like this after i had just gone through chemo and had been fighting for my life was unthinkable and i know im not the only one they have treated in this mannernever again will i do business with this bank or recommend this bank to anyone i know i would rather put my money under my mattress before i let these people within a mile of it there are some genuinely good people who work as tellers there but the majority of the rest in my experience will do anything and say anything to get you to open an account and then will be rude and belligerent when you catch them in their lie and will never try

"bt makes a practice of calculating debits before deposits to illegally incur excessive overdraft charges this happened to my boyfriend but not to my account because i did not optin for overdraft protection none of my deposits ever went into pending status because i did not optin that is how you avoid their nightmare theft period if you have overdraft protection any deposits that you make whether you make them cash or checks will all be considered mixed deposits allowing them to be put in pending status for average of three or four days which means that anything that comes through as a debit will probably overdraft and incur an overdraft fee ofeach so by the time your deposits are factored in you will be significantly in the hole i compared my account to my boyfriends and i was never charged a fee none of my deposits went into pending status and i would recommend anyone who wants to fight back to opt out of overdraft protection and do straight accounting or get another bank this bank makes millions of dollars in interest on those overdraft fees billions of dollars so consumers need to stop optin for overdraft protection and your deposits will never be in pending status and they cant make overdraft money on youwhats amazing is they offer overdraft protection but its trickery it is a bait and switch tactic at its worst and they will literally screw you with what they offer as protection because opting in puts all of your deposits in pending status and then all of the debits come in pretending theres a zero balance causing an overdraft after each and everyone before the deposits are even added in and pending can happen on average fordays so youre really screwed it is such an unethical practice to grow billions of dollars in theft and interest on that stolen money oh my god how does the fdic allow these shysters to be in business they penned cash deposits and call them mixed deposits so they can play that game too but they wont do it two accounts they dont opt into overdraft protection my account is straight accounting and ive never had anything like that happen but my boyfriends account has incurredin overdraft fees its three or four months because all the deposits gets set aside as if they dont exist and each debit comes in first incurring individual overdraft fees then deposits are factored in even cash it is so disgustingly illegalview more","joy","negative"

"y plan was to close my account at bbt after being confronted with numerous policy changes since bbt bought the bank that i was very happy with bankatlantic my account had not been set up yet at another bank where i had just opened an account so i wanted to leave some money in my debit account in order be able to pay bills during the transition i continued to use my bbt debit card for things like gas and groceries each time when i was asked or prompted i specifically indicated that the funds were to be withdrawn from my debit account for each purchase because i said it was a debit account i was asked to provide my pin so there was no doubt between me and the merchant that i was making a purchase with a debit card because of that i thought that when the funds ran out in that account i would no longer be able to make purchases because thats the way debit accounts work so i thought i would use the card until the funds ran out and then close the accountyesterday i got a letter from bbt saying that i had been charged overdraft fees so i went to the bank today and found out that the funds had run out two weeks ago and they have been charging me overdraft fees ever sinceon each purchase since almost all of my purchases were underthe balance on my account ended up beingoverdraft fees then there were overdraft fees for eachdays that the balance was mostly overdraft fees in other words overdraft fees were being compounded on top of overdraft fees its no wonder two weeks went by before i was alerted that this was going on it was not in the interest of bbt that i be informed of the situation since they were making more money the more it went on when i told the officer that i thought the way debit cards worked was that i was only allowed to withdraw funds that existed in the account he told me that the account was not a debit account and that whether or not i knew it i had been inducted his word into a checking accountthen there is theoverdraft charge that was supposed to befees for five purchases when i counted only four purchases the bank officer moved one of the charges that had occurred on a later date on the sheet to go above thecharge in order to make it look like the five charges had occurred on a prior date either way i still have to pay the same fee but it smacks of dishonesty to be altering my records in order to justify their mistake i have both printouts the one that shows only four purchases and the one she altered that shows five while i had been waiting to hear this carpetbagger nonsense i sat listening to an elderly woman who came to this officer for help she was most certainly in her s barely capable of walking with arthritis so bad each finger was bent in a different direction apparently her social security checks had not been deposited in her account for several months as they were supposed to be directdeposited from the social security administration the man that she spoke to at bbt had absolutely no sympathy he kept telling her that this was her problem and that the bank wasnt going to do anything to help her she pleaded with him to help her he told her to call the social security office she said she had and that they make her wait for hours before she can find someone to talk to and then they tell her that her checks were going to another account and that they cant know that she is who she says she is so there is nothing they can do to help her clearly her identity had been stolen i couldnt believe it when bbt told her to go away and solve the problem on her own after someminutes of pleading with them to help her what are they expecting her to do go to whoever stole her identity and confront them by herself i knew that bbt was a nasty bank but what i didnt know was that the employees they have hired since taking over bankatlantic have ice water running through their veinsview more","joy","negative"

"i am a victim of a mortgage loan fraud ive been struggling for overyears due to this incident i bought a property which was inflated by the seller in one day overthe seller was also a mortgage broker whom i had known for overyears the loan officer from the bbt bank appraiser realtor and the title company eventually all assisted the seller to flip the property the lender was bbt bank and the loan officer who was engaged in this fraudulent loan transaction was greg n in fairfax branchin novemberwe purchased a vacant lot and bbt financed our mortgage for the lot the seller was mrk who was a mortgage broker after the settlement for this property i felt something was not right and began asking questions to mrk the seller and also a mortgage broker after i learned that i had right to obtain a copy of the appraisal reporti requested appraisal report and several loan documents from bbt and began to examine the loan documents as well as two appraisal reports which were prepared by one of the bbts independent contractor while i was examining the documents i found many odd things some of the signatures were forged the construction drawing was switched right after the loan was approved the appraiser apparently used the bigger drawing in order to inflate the value of the lot i had strong feeling that something was not right and the loan transaction was done improperly thats when i decided to see the president of bbti first met with don s the regional president of bbt inat his office in falls church virginia at that time i did not have many concrete evidences to provide regarding this loan i just felt suspicious about it i explained to him about how i felt about this loan transaction and requested him to internally investigate on my loan documents and the underwriting department including the loan officer greg n at that time mrs also felt that something was done incorrectly and he had promised me that he would internally investigate on my file since i did not get any response from bbt i began to research on this loan transaction by myself with help of my relative and private detective as well as attorney february offor the second time my attorney and one of my relatives jay went to meet with mark r l bbt banks attorney mark l at that time understood the situation but he was trying to deny everything to protect bbt he said that he would talk to the loan officer and others who was engaged in this particular loan transaction and would get back to ushowever again we did not hear back from him since then regarding this case june ofwe contacted state of north carolina office of the bank commissioner of banks to file a complaint against bbt we had meeting for abouthours with the bank commissioners we went over each document which was falsified and manipulated by both the seller as well as a mortgage broker for my loan and greg n the loan officer at bbt after the meeting they clearly realized what went wrong and how bbt had violated the bank regulationeven one of the bank commissioners recommended us to file a law suit against bbt immediatelyafter the meeting the bank commissioner sent letter to bbt regarding this particular loan transaction bbt replied to their letter in julywhen we received the letter which bank commissioner had forwarded to us we were pretty much in shock attorney at bbt bank apparently denied all the facts and falsely stated in that letter about their actfinally we had chance to meet with don s the regional president at bbt for the third time in novemberwe told mr s that the letter which was sent to bank commissioner stated all the wrongfacts i told him that the reason why we went to see mr s was to let him know that whatever mark l attorney of bbt stated in that letter was not true it was all lie probably he wrote the letter based on what greg n the loan officer at bbt had stated to protect him and bbt this time we had more concrete evidences and documents which support the fact on fraudulent loan transaction however mr s was not even willing to open his mind even to listen he did not care about the truth he said that he only believes whatever stated in that letter he ignored us completely and did not care about the fact and moreover he did not want to know the truth this leaves me with extreme anger and frustration and i had decided that i would be willing to spend rest of my life to reveal the truth and let the whole world know how disgusted and untruthful bbt was and how bbt destroyed my life although this was a ridiculous loan i kept on paying for overyears in order to keep my credit in good standing the total mortgage payment that ive made was totalingand the litigation fee and all other miscellaneous cost me overthe grand total that i lost due to negligence of the lender and fraudulent loan transaction ismy credit got destroyed and currently im facing a foreclosure on this property all i wanted to hear back from bbt was to reexamine the whole loan documents and try to find out what went wrong and how it happened and how they could rectify the problem i know that you can not give me any legal advice on this and also you dont have any agencies who can investigate on mortgage fraudhowever i believe that at least someone should know about the fact that how such a big lender like bbt ruined someones life entirely and do not have any conscience to acknowledge what they had done wrong im sure that there is a justice somewhere and i strongly believe that theres someone out there who really cares about the justice and the truthbbt is a big lender who has money and power and able to get away from all the evil acts i however am a minority and do not have sufficient money to fight and do not have any kinds of power to reveal the truth about the fact however i am not going to give this up and i will do whatever i could to reveal how terrible ignorant and untruthful bbt isbbt is so greedy that they violated the bank regulation not only greg n the loan officer but also many other loan officers like greg n are doing the same things as greg did bbt is acting as if they are whole sale lenderthey do not contact the borrower and use middle man such as mortgage broker to get more sales i have discovered some names of loan officers at bbt who never contact the borrower and only dealt with the mortgage broker which is violating the bank regulationi have hadlawyers so far for civil litigation and they all acknowledged the problems but they did not want to proceed with the law suit against such a big lender bbt bank for your record right after this incident novemberthe seller was committed bank fraud and money laundry and sentenced for overyears now he is imprisoned federal prison in mcrae georgialast month i went to see him seller he had confessed that he did feel guilty about the whole situation he also told me that the loan transaction was possible because the loan officer at bbt bank assisted him to flip the property the seller specifically told me how the loan officer at bbt bank the appraiser real estate agent and the title company all assisted him to get the fraudulent loan approved the loan officer at bbt bankhad to meet certain volume for each months and he asked this seller who was also a mortgage broker to bring more clients to him the seller who was also a mortgage broker contacted the loan officer greg n at bbt bank directly the problem was that bbt bank was not a wholesale lender and they must contact the borrower directly but the bank loan officer was contacted by seller mortgage broker and approved the loan based on the information provided by the seller the loan officer at bbtbank had never contacted the borrower the bank not only violated bank regulation but also they violated the federal law us patriot act i tried to meet with the financial crime department in fairfax county and i even went to see the fbi agent in tysons corner first of all i could not even have a meeting with the financial crime department they do not return my calls and when i went to their office to meet one of the agents the security would not even let me in the building because i did not have an appointment with the agent how could i make an appointment when they do not return my phone call second of all when i visited fbi agent he seemed like he understood the whole situation and believed that this was not done correctly but again i was ignoredsometimes i wonder if they would treat me differently if i was a mainstream in america perhaps the reason i did not get all the help that i could was because i was a minoritythis is not an easy story to listen to and i am not sure if you could do anything for this case but i have to try everything i could to fight for justice so please contact me when you get a chance so that i could provide you with more detail evidences for this casealthough this was a ridiculous loan i kept on paying for overyears in order to keep my
