Just a few months ago we paid an overdraft charge on an account that doesn’t even have overdraft, but decided to take the hit and pay it ourselves instead of raising a stink. This happened way before this whole fiasco started. 

Now there is money moving in and out of our account constantly and it’s impossible to manage it. The balance seen when we check the app or website isn’t our genuine balance and we’re being charged for transactions that happened last week and that we assumed had already been withdrawn from our account. Just paid them $100 or so in money overdrawn while our balance was inaccurate and not up to date, after talking to an employee at our local branch and now our account says it’s overdrawn again by $15. SO gets a paycheck tomorrow and I’m honestly scared it’s all going to disappear. 

I’m disappointed in BB&T and feel like I can’t trust them with our money anymore. Really considering changing banks because we can’t afford to have money disappear and have a transaction list not even the BB&T employee at our local branch could make heads or tails of.

I have a home ecquity line of credit in which has been paid timely for 14 years.  It has come to my attention that the word “line advance” meant someone used this line to get cash without my knowledge or consent. 

I have contacted BBT for two years with hour long holds, and people being dumbfounded as to what to do.

I have filed a police report and a fraud affidavit and am now seeking legal counsel.

I should not be responsible for any checks or fraud on this account.

The police detective was unable to get any details from BBT. I would like this account closed and am willing to pay something to settle it.

Your institution did not protect my identify and assets and at this point feel I must take every action within my power to address this.

Can someone please forward this to the executive office? My cell is 207-332-7068. I will b stopping payments or your company can reach out to address this. I have emails, attorney letters, police reports, and more to demonstrate my attempts at addressing this. A bank has a responsibility to protect their client and their assets.

I JUST OPENED MY ACCT LESS THAN A WEEK AGO AND CAN ALREADY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN BOLD THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!! When opening a checking and savings account, I was prompted to deposit $50 into each account with my debit card from my other bank in order to make a deposit. So I used my debit card and deposited $50 into each account-checking and savings. They only put $50 into the checking account and as a result when using my card I went into -$26. I called them at 11 PM to tell them that I could not figure out how to add funds with my debit card to correct the balance and bring it out of the negative and was trying to do so by midnight so I would not receive over withdraw fees. The initial employee I spoke with said I could only add funds at the branch which at that point was closed. They also told me the cut off time for charges was 9pm, not midnight which I have never even heard of before. I explained my concern that I was never informed that using a debit card to add funds was only an option when making an initial deposit and not available in the future. He agreed and stated that it was a “good question,” but said he could not solve my problem and help me fix my balance to prevent any fees, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. Upon speaking to the supervisor -no exaggeration - he would not let me speak and continued to talk over me. When I expressed my feelings in regards to not being informed when signing up that I could not use my debit card in the future to add funds he responded “well it didn’t say you could either, did it?” I was so appalled that it took me a minute to gather my thoughts because I literally thought I was dreaming to be treated like this by not only any employee—but a supervisor. I haven’t even gotten to the worst part.... in response to his rude comment, I asked him if he would please allow me speak and stop speaking over me so I could try to prevent getting charged $216 yes that is correct ($36 per transaction up to 6 transactions a day from what he told me) even though I opted out of being able to over withdraw, and he HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!!!!!! I am still in disbelief as I type this and I will do every single possible thing regardless if I have to spend every second of my day to make sure that this never happens to anyone else who signs up with this piece of you know what scam artist that they call a “business.” I will report them to the Better Business Bureau, I will plaster it on Facebook, I will plaster it on Twitter, I will plastered on telephone poles if I have to because I am DISGUSTED and because they are simply deserving of it as well as the innocent VICTIMS that they refer to as customers. I hope to God that they record their conversations so that they have it when I take this further.

I was assigned this lady online. I asked via email about their policy on check deposits. She told me to come into the bank. Why would I come into the bank? It annoyed me that I had to ask the question again, so I let her know I could call corporate and asked them. She immediately answered my question and removed herself from being my banker and added someone else. LOL... I was never rude. Now Ms. Alvarez is my new banker. She probably has no idea. I've emailed her and Mr. Noel. They have yet to reply back. It's been 6 days. I have already been helped by Erica online, but that's not the point. I called the local bank and Jenny answered. I asked Jenny how do I see my transactions on the websight. She tells me she doesn't know and transfers me to someones voicemail. This was something I needed immediately, not whenever someone can call me back. I called back and I ask Jenny why she doesn't know where to find transaction history on my account. Jenny told me she could not help me navigate the websight because she was busy helping someone else. Seriously !!! So, I called A BBT in Ashberg, NC and was helped immediately by the person who answered the phone. I don't need any help I just want BBT to see how awful the customer service is in clarksburg and Bridgeport, WV. I don't remember if Jenny was in the Bridgeport office or Clarksburg. She definitely needs some training !!! Update 3/11/2018 Now Ms. Alvarez removed herself and added mr noel as my banker because of this post I'm sure..

My question is I already received 2 overdraft fees for 2 of my 3 duplicate transactions. I now have just over $2 in my account but should have more. When this transaction that disappeared finally reappears will i be charged another overdraft fee???,Positive
1670522863027604_1671243012955589,2018-02-27T13:06:27+0000,I made a deposit yesterday of 400$ cash and it’s not even in my bank account today! But it was yesterday?!

I didn't like what happened either but we all need to be positive and cooperate with BB&T as best as we can to help get back on track..,Positive

My husband and i noticed problems of duplicate charges during the start of the weekend. shortly after we saw posts from BBT claiming they will fix the issues. They not only have not fixed the issue they have made it worse. Duplicate charges that started to get credits to correct them were removed and our tax money that was deposited as short with no explanation as to why they took money from our account. I went to the bank after trying to reach someone on the 24hr hotline, no answer of course.. Tomorrow we are withdrawing all but 30 dollars from our account and going to another bank..They can play with their money but not ours. We work too hard for them to charge us fees and duplicate charges and take money with no reason as to why and the bank reps say they cannot help. they are as much in the dark as we are.. Stupid bank lied and said a mouse ate their wire and caused all this.. Apparently they haven't caught the mouse and its still eating wires lol",Negative

Maybe some day BBT will actually get their mess straightened OUT! UPDATE: logged in about 6:20 AM and now it appears things are actually correct. I won’t have complete faith that it will stay that way until I can watch my account for several days. Hope and pray we don’t have to go through this again.

I was assigned this lady online. I asked via email about their policy on check deposits. She told me to come into the bank. Why would I come into the bank? It annoyed me that I had to ask the question again, so I let her know I could call corporate and asked them. She immediately answered my question and removed herself from being my banker and added someone else. LOL... I was never rude. Now Ms. Alvarez is my new banker. She probably has no idea. I've emailed her and Mr. Noel. They have yet to reply back. It's been 6 days. I have already been helped by Erica online, but that's not the point. I called the local bank and Jenny answered. I asked Jenny how do I see my transactions on the websight. She tells me she doesn't know and transfers me to someones voicemail. This was something I needed immediately, not whenever someone can call me back. I called back and I ask Jenny why she doesn't know where to find transaction history on my account. Jenny told me she could not help me navigate the websight because she was busy helping someone else. Seriously !!! So, I called A BBT in Ashberg, NC and was helped immediately by the person who answered the phone. I don't need any help I just want BBT to see how awful the customer service is in clarksburg and Bridgeport, WV. I don't remember if Jenny was in the Bridgeport office or Clarksburg. She definitely needs some training !!! Update 3/11/2018 Now Ms. Alvarez removed herself and added mr noel as my banker because of this post I'm sure.. LMFAO...I already filed a complaint on BBB website and corporate office. I really hope their something done about your horrible customer service. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BE><ed><U+00B4><U+00A3><ed><U+00A0><U+00BE><ed><U+00B4><U+00A3>",Positive

I JUST OPENED MY ACCT LESS THAN A WEEK AGO AND CAN ALREADY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN BOLD THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!! When opening a checking and savings account, I was prompted to deposit $50 into each account with my debit card from my other bank in order to make a deposit. So I used my debit card and deposited $50 into each account-checking and savings. They only put $50 into the checking account and as a result when using my card I went into -$26. I called them at 11 PM to tell them that I could not figure out how to add funds with my debit card to correct the balance and bring it out of the negative and was trying to do so by midnight so I would not receive over withdraw fees. The initial employee I spoke with said I could only add funds at the branch which at that point was closed. They also told me the cut off time for charges was 9pm, not midnight which I have never even heard of before. I explained my concern that I was never informed that using a debit card to add funds was only an option when making an initial deposit and not available in the future. He agreed and stated that it was a “good question,” but said he could not solve my problem and help me fix my balance to prevent any fees, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. Upon speaking to the supervisor -no exaggeration - he would not let me speak and continued to talk over me. When I expressed my feelings in regards to not being informed when signing up that I could not use my debit card in the future to add funds he responded “well it didn’t say you could either, did it?” I was so appalled that it took me a minute to gather my thoughts because I literally thought I was dreaming to be treated like this by not only any employee—but a supervisor. I haven’t even gotten to the worst part.... in response to his rude comment, I asked him if he would please allow me speak and stop speaking over me so I could try to prevent getting charged $216 yes that is correct ($36 per transaction up to 6 transactions a day from what he told me) even though I opted out of being able to over withdraw, and he HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!!!!!! I am still in disbelief as I type this and I will do every single possible thing regardless if I have to spend every second of my day to make sure that this never happens to anyone else who signs up with this piece of you know what scam artist that they call a “business.” I will report them to the Better Business Bureau, I will plaster it on Facebook, I will plaster it on Twitter, I will plastered on telephone poles if I have to because I am DISGUSTED and because they are simply deserving of it as well as the innocent VICTIMS that they refer to as customers. I hope to God that they record their conversations so that they have it when I take this further.

Kind of funny that you don't have the fingerprint on the mobile device anymore. That there's multiple issues with debt and credit cards. That I have called and talked to different people at BB&T some have said it's a malfunction some people have said it's a software issue. But nobody could tell me the exact same thing and this is from the beginning to today. It's kind of very unlikely that there's not safeguards prevent this from happening. It's amazing how one machine can cripple eyes the entire network. How stupid and naive do you think we are. Maybe we are that stupid and naive trust in a bank that one machine could cripple the entire system. There's a reason why the power grids are not on one big central line. So if the West Coast goes down the East Coast doesn't. Maybe I am to blame for not doing my research on the bank and seeing that they have so many faulty issues or maybe it's just stupidity.

Read all the posts, hear what these people are saying!!!! They aren’t whining! They are at a deficit! Through no fault of their own! Each and every one of us HAS BEEN WRONGED.

I have one on my account, there is no general deposit correcting the double charge, and I'm afraid to use my account at all. I may stay with you as a customer, I may not; I'm still deciding. This has been very disconcerting. And I've been a customer since KNBT got bought by National Penn, and then National Penn was bought too.",Positive

No local branches so spent HOURS on the phone because they mischarged fees; locked my accounts repeatedly; never received new debit cards or correspondence by mail or email; and the final nail in their greedy corporate coffin was when they put my accounts in dormancy. Again NO correspondence of any kind alerting me of their impending action; I was never made aware of such a policy, by post or electronically. Their bizarre explanation was, ""A little longer  (in this dormant state) and ALL my money would've gone to the federal government""! Was that an effort toward an apology, that I should somehow be grateful to them?!

It's a terrible thing that so many have suffered so much anxiety by not having access to their accounts and money. I know firsthand how embarrassing and stressful it is when you swipe your card to pay for groceries, for example, the card is declined and you have to leave the store empty-handed with people staring. It's incredibly humiliating, but worse still is you have to tell your kids there's nothing for dinner!

I've never encountered such a HUGE problem with any bank before! We have banked with BB&T for several years and this has never happened before. Not having access to our direct deposit for 24 hours, not even knowing how much it is, is a little unnerving. We trust banks to keep our money in check for us so we don't have to worry so much about it. Had I not got paid from a different account and us having a little cash on hand, this could've been a lot worse. I do have to paya late fee on one of our bills that was being paid out of our BB&T account though because they charge it after day one past the due date which was Friday. This to me, should not have happened. There should be back up systems in place. I was completely ready to move ALL of our accounts elsewhere and if we continue to have issues, we will.",Negative

I live in Manassas, VA and you have way too much competition for me to tolerate this. I have been told numerous times by management that the reason branches are closing and hours are shortened is because the money is being put into technology. The branches around me are in complete chaos!!! They're closing and shortening hours. So while there are three branches in Manassas VA, only one has Saturday hours, and even they act like they're doing us a favor. The branch nearest to me closes at 5 pm. All the while other banks are opening branches on every street corner, with normal bank closing hours of 7 pm. The last straw, Mr. King, was when I left work early (as I always have to in order to do my banking) to make a business deposit and cash two personal checks I wasn't able to complete my transactions. Ohhhhh rest assured you could take the deposit. But you couldn't cash my checks. So somehow you're willing to take money in, but can't give me MY money from a check that was drawn on BB & T as well. And the kicker is that it was from a mainframe computer crash. What happened to all the money put into technology? Are you seriously trying to tell me you don't have some type of backup system??? I run a small business with 6 employees and even I have a backup system. This would have been way more palatable had I been notified of this. I get emails from BB & T all the time wanting to loan me money. But not for something that truly impacts me and TONS of others. So you, sir, are a snake!!! A good, decent, honest person would have alerted your customers WHEN IT HAPPENED. Not after it goes viral on social media and in the news. How do you even lay your head on the pillow at night? HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE way to do business. Especially a bank. Money, and access to OUR money is a daily thing. See most of us aren't the 1% like you, Mr. King. I know your total pay between salary, bonuses, and stock dividends in 2016 was over $8M. Most of us will never earn that in a lifetime. So how could you possibly realize how this grave mistake affects the rest of us? Well, I am one of the many people who will show you - by moving my money. I was informed by one of your employees that BB & T is one of the top 10 banks in America. I asked her what criteria she was using and she couldn't answer.

I called Friday and was helped by a friendly associate who answered my questions. Yes this was an inconvenience but I cannot imagine what it must have been like for the associates working there. I am sure BB&T was doing their very best to try to handle a difficult situation. We are so quick to criticize others when we are inconvenienced. What if we were to try a little kindness and instead of only thinking of ourselves thought of others as well. Yes this has been challenging for us as customers but it has been much harder for the employees who are having to deal with constant calls and I'm sure many rude customers.

How are you going to make it right, are you pay me for my inconvenience? I highly doubt it, my money will be leaving your bank. A technical issue can be understandable but Bb&t is one of the biggest banks up the East Coast, where was the back up system there is no way it should have taken this long especially for a bank to come back online.  Bb&t makes enough money that they should have top notch equipment.  I was originally a National Penn customer until you both merged, it is sad that my perfectly good bank that I always banked with was bought out by Bb&t. Since the merger the fees have went up and the quality of customer service has plummeted.  Plus I never had an offline/ outage issue with National Penn and with Bb&t it seems quite normal that there’s system issues, normally it’s for a short period of time but this time the amount of time with an outage is was more than unacceptable. I wouldn’t be surprised if you don’t lose 30% or more of your customers. Also how do I explain to my son that I couldn’t pull the rest of his payment out of my bank account to pay for his Boyscout camp?  The deadline now has passed for payment so I have to explain to him now he can’t go?!?! Would you like to do that for me since you sincerely apologize and your doing so much to make it right! How?

I feel sure they will handle this appropriately, The bills I paid online are showing up as well, and were paid. It hasn't been a big issue with me. I wish all of you the best.

Dee Glass You have another outage, in your mortgage department in Estero Fl. I am sure that your CEO and the other shareholders could care less about a customer's bad experience because your bank is now to big, but I had a dreadful experience with your Mortage Dept in Estero FL. It was a 4 month process of me trying to purchase a home in Florida and after 4 months the sellers backed out for the 3rd time and final time. The seller, myself and the title company over and over again would supply BBT with the same documents over and over again, only to be asked again for the same ones. I even had to help the BBT lady to figure out my monthly income. I was only borrowing 1/3 of the house price and had all of the positive things in place to be your best possible mortgage applicant and your employees were just dreadful, so much so, that I can post right here snapshots from the title company and the realtor, stating their disgust with the incompetence of your mortgage department. After we were all fed up with this application process, I reached out to John, the boss of that Dept and guess what, he would always promise to call me back but never would. That man was so overpaid, it was ridiculous. IT WAS LIKE  A REALLY BAD MOVIE. BBT you lost out on a perfect applicant for a mortgage because you have some serious slackers in Ester Fl. My credit is 749 and I was only borrowing a small amount. They also approved me for 350K and then they let me pay for the home inspection, the water test and then a 500.00 appraisals for of course BBT's pockets only to leave me hanging on OCT 31 with no closing. The Seller backed out, He was so done waiting and when I said I will see you in court to bank people, I then received a dated letter over a month later, denying my approval. BBT if you were the last bank on earth, I would never apply for a mortgage with you. EVEN ANOTHER BOSS, at another location, told me the mortgage dept was awful and he has known about it for a while.

I could only assume what had happened, and know exactly the pain to both bring the systems online, recover, and then the tedious nature of making it right by sometimes manually looking at every account.  I did note this morning that the one fee which I received was already credited back, and everything looks right with my account.  As I was checking into this, I said to myself...hmm...the only thing missing now would be an explanation and an apology...and whatdayaknow...what should appear before my very eyes.  So, all told...sure, it was painful and a little worrisome...but, in my eyes, it was handled as well as could be expected.  I, for one, am not put off by the experience...things like this will happen.

I was purchasing life-sustaining meds, and it appeared to the pharmacy that the card was faulty, or their credit/debit card machine was inoperable.

A week later BB&T authorized, processed and paid seven duplicate charges, and corresponding ""international"" fees.

I attempted to call, and was on hold for 21 minutes, at a cost of $17, only to be disconnected once an agent picked up.

I have been dealing with the pharmacy, down here, to rectify the situation as BB&T has absolutely no support for anyone outside of the continental US.

800 numbers are worthless. They have no capability to chat with an agent, as many other corporations offer.

I intend on closing my account with BB&T once I return, as it is so costly to interface them on an international level.

1) the website was only down for a few hours. But people have multiple over draft fees. I don't understand how that happened. Do people not keep an actual ledger anymore. I've never had any issues with them and my personal ledger always matches their online documentation. It has been off 3 times by a few cents, because I made a error, not them.
2) Technology fails all the time, even for banks. So don't wait until last minute to pay your bills etc. Pay them in advance and always have emergency cash.
3) I don't do automatic withdrawal personally, so maybe your struggle is different than mine. I get paid, then pay all my bills for the next 2 weeks. Maybe the glitch wouldn't have affected you if you planned better. It was only down for a few hours.

You can file a complaint online at consumerfinance.gov. The representative I spoke with was very alarmed to hear that BB&T had accepted funds, made them available to me, and then “lost” them. She said the only time this is ok is if the deposit did not  have sufficient funds (ie: a bounced check). If it were the other way around and we had made a mistake, BB&T would have charged overdraft fees without hesitation.

I JUST OPENED MY ACCT LESS THAN A WEEK AGO AND CAN ALREADY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN BOLD THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!! When opening a checking and savings account, I was prompted to deposit $50 into each account with my debit card from my other bank in order to make a deposit. So I used my debit card and deposited $50 into each account-checking and savings. They only put $50 into the checking account and as a result when using my card I went into -$26. I called them at 11 PM to tell them that I could not figure out how to add funds with my debit card to correct the balance and bring it out of the negative and was trying to do so by midnight so I would not receive over withdraw fees. The initial employee I spoke with said I could only add funds at the branch which at that point was closed. They also told me the cut off time for charges was 9pm, not midnight which I have never even heard of before. I explained my concern that I was never informed that using a debit card to add funds was only an option when making an initial deposit and not available in the future. He agreed and stated that it was a “good question,” but said he could not solve my problem and help me fix my balance to prevent any fees, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. Upon speaking to the supervisor -no exaggeration - he would not let me speak and continued to talk over me. When I expressed my feelings in regards to not being informed when signing up that I could not use my debit card in the future to add funds he responded “well it didn’t say you could either, did it?” I was so appalled that it took me a minute to gather my thoughts because I literally thought I was dreaming to be treated like this by not only any employee—but a supervisor. I haven’t even gotten to the worst part.... in response to his rude comment, I asked him if he would please allow me speak and stop speaking over me so I could try to prevent getting charged $216 yes that is correct ($36 per transaction up to 6 transactions a day from what he told me) even though I opted out of being able to over withdraw, and he HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!!!!!! I am still in disbelief as I type this and I will do every single possible thing regardless if I have to spend every second of my day to make sure that this never happens to anyone else who signs up with this piece of you know what scam artist that they call a “business.” I will report them to the Better Business Bureau, I will plaster it on Facebook, I will plaster it on Twitter, I will plastered on telephone poles if I have to because I am DISGUSTED and because they are simply deserving of it as well as the innocent VICTIMS that they refer to as customers. I hope to God that they record their conversations so that they have it when I take this further. I don’t care if it’s for a penny or a million dollars, NO ONE DESERVES TO BE TREATED LIKE I WAS TONIGHT AND I WILL MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE EXPERIENCES WHAT I DID.

Get tons of emails trying to sell me stuff almost daily but this stiff gets no direct communication. Instead customers have to monitor social flipping media to get updates.   Seriously?  Yeah BBT you use Twitter and Facebook as the primary form of communication for something this big.  3 days of financial screw ups, less than appropriate full information disclosure.

And also that they will reimburse anyone for any charges or late fees due to this problem. I am a payroll manager and I know it has been very frustrating for our employees that their deposits weren't in their accounts on Friday. Me being one of those employees. But I advise people to try and do banking at more than one bank. If you can put at least $10 every payday in another account at a different bank you'll have some cushion money for any issues that come up. Or just keep a little jar with cash in it  for those emergencies. There's no system that's foolproof and will never break down. The problem is people rely too much on technology these days. They don't know what to do when things stop working. I know this will definitely make people think about how to do things differently in the future.,Positive

However, we have been told by several sources it was ONE piece of equipment that brought your institution to it's knees.  I went 48 hours without access to my money (which I am not that angry about).  What I was angry about was the refusal at a branch to give me a cashier's check ( I know it had to do with the systems).  I was also angry when I went into a branch today to cancel my credit card (it had a zero balance for 3 years) and your employee not only tried to justify your position by saying ""This could happen at any bank"" she also said ""If you move to member one, they have terrible customer service ratings"".  My response: so will you.  Close the account and give me my cash.  

Member One gave me 200 dollars for opening a free account.  Your worker told me you would give us 25 dollars for the inconveniences.  You are losing in every way.  
Your name is Branch Bank & Trust.  The trust is broken.  Even if it wasn't a cyber attack, there is a massive incompetence in your IT department.  Lack of redundant systems is unexcusable.  And using the excuse ""These things happen.."" Are you serious?  They really don't.  This has never happened to me.  Wells Fargo never had an issue like this.  
I explained to your employee that they are doing a great job.  They are doing what they can.  And I apologized to them for me removing my business from your institution.

I appreciate your friendly positive posts 12 hours ago about how everything that has crashed over the last 72 hours will be remidied tonight, yet my debit card gets declined this evening when there is exponentially  more money in the account than I was needing for the transaction. Lucky for me, I was only a mile from my house and had the cash available. But what if I were on vacation this week and was using my debit card all week? What if I was taking my family out for a birthday dinner and my 200 dollar meal was declined and I had no other form of payment? 

What I fail to understand, and by all means, someone is welcome to call and explain it to me from your corporate office, is why you don't  have redundant server systems to fail over to when something happens? It's no secret data centers experience equipment failures, but that's why you have back up systems located in other data centers that allow you to fail over to a stable system until your main is restored. 

You are in control of millions of families financial security, mine included, along with the business finances of thousands of small businesses, mine included, and it is very disturbing to see what a nightmare your company has allowed to transpire over the last three, going on four days. Even more disturbing, is the fact that over those almost four days, I have not received one call from BB&T, locally, or from a corporate call center, warning me that I may have issues using funds that I assumed should be available. I had to find out at the point of sale and that is simply unacceptable.

Truly hope you make this right with ALL that have been affected by this SNAFU, currently, and the unforeseen circumstances that may occur due to the outage in the future.  Zero updates of true substance is very concerning and ""Equipment Malfunction"" really does not make sense unless it was catastrophic (i.e. wind, fire, water, earthquake . . . acts of god) Having worked in many ""mission critical"" data centers over the decades I understand the pressure placed on the technicians, field engineers, systems engineers, and the like during a crisis of this magnitude. ( Don't shove all of the weight on the technicians please ) ""Equipment malfunction"" happens. Contracting or ""farming out"" the maintenance of our hardware infrastructure (networking and computing equipment) comes with a risk. That risk includes not being in complete control over the maintenance and operability of the ""equipment"" Typically this service is set out to a bidding process and awarded to a contractor that assumes the risk and graded on performance and uptime. Critical parts ""equipment"" are typically placed on-site and throughout the country in strategic locations to be dispatched quickly to the area requiring them by the contractor ( the technician in the end.)  I think we all understand you are doing your best to restore service to us, your consumers, but please don't cover up what's going on by placing all of the burden to the catch all ""equipment malfunction"" and the technicians in the trenches.  Not good business.  You're a fool if you think this will make things easier on BB&T and retain your clients by covering up the true problem(s).  The only way to prevent this type of situation in the future is to shine a flood light on it, locate the root cause of it, share the information about it, correct it, and finally update your contingency plans accordingly.  Thanks for listening..",Positive

My card has been declined 3 times, can’t get cash out of our ATM locally as it is “temporarily out of order” and we live 40 minutes from the next branch.

My local branch is already only open M-F from 8-4 and closes every Wednesday at noon so everyone can go to “church”, and no Saturday hours. I couldn’t even get there from work to withdrawal any cash Thursday or Friday on my lunch. The IT department apparently all need to be fired as this is something that should be prepared for and back up everything should be available, including mirrored servers that can kick in when the master goes down.  You are a financial institution making millions each year off of the “pending” charges scam alone. Use that for new server centers.

I JUST OPENED MY ACCT LESS THAN A WEEK AGO AND CAN ALREADY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN BOLD THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!! When opening a checking and savings account, I was prompted to deposit $50 into each account with my debit card from my other bank in order to make a deposit. So I used my debit card and deposited $50 into each account-checking and savings. They only put $50 into the checking account and as a result when using my card I went into -$26. I called them at 11 PM to tell them that I could not figure out how to add funds with my debit card to correct the balance and bring it out of the negative and was trying to do so by midnight so I would not receive over withdraw fees. The initial employee I spoke with said I could only add funds at the branch which at that point was closed. They also told me the cut off time for charges was 9pm, not midnight which I have never even heard of before. I explained my concern that I was never informed that using a debit card to add funds was only an option when making an initial deposit and not available in the future. He agreed and stated that it was a “good question,” but said he could not solve my problem and help me fix my balance to prevent any fees, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. Upon speaking to the supervisor -no exaggeration - he would not let me speak and continued to talk over me. When I expressed my feelings in regards to not being informed when signing up that I could not use my debit card in the future to add funds he responded “well it didn’t say you could either, did it?” I was so appalled that it took me a minute to gather my thoughts because I literally thought I was dreaming to be treated like this by not only any employee—but a supervisor. I haven’t even gotten to the worst part.... in response to his rude comment, I asked him if he would please allow me speak and stop speaking over me so I could try to prevent getting charged $216 yes that is correct ($36 per transaction up to 6 transactions a day from what he told me) even though I opted out of being able to over withdraw, and he HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!!!!!! I am still in disbelief as I type this and I will do every single possible thing regardless if I have to spend every second of my day to make sure that this never happens to anyone else who signs up with this piece of you know what scam artist that they call a “business.” I will report them to the Better Business Bureau, I will plaster it on Facebook, I will plaster it on Twitter, I will plastered on telephone poles if I have to because I am DISGUSTED and because they are simply deserving of it as well as the innocent VICTIMS that they refer to as customers. I hope to God that they record their conversations so that they have it when I take this further. I don’t care if it’s for a penny or a million dollars, NO ONE DESERVES TO BE TREATED LIKE I WAS TONIGHT AND I WILL MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE EXPERIENCES WHAT I DID.

I tried to get cash out of my local BB&T atm machine in the midst of this debacle, before I was aware of the problem. There was no sign on the atm machine to warn me not to use it. The money was debited from my account but BB&T’s ATM machine did not give me my cash. BB&T knew that this was an ongoing issue, yet they did not even bother to put up an “out of order” sign on the atm machine.  I sat and watched in utter shock as customer after customer repeatedly attempted to withdraw cash without success, the money immediately was immediately debited from their account, but NO cash was forthcoming from the atm machine. I drove to another BB&T branch nearby to see if it was happening there too and it was! No out of order sign on the atm. Customer after customer trying to withdraw cash. Each one then parking and going into the bank to find out what they could do to get to their money. I watched this go on for 25 minutes. All the while BB&T did nothing to stop them. Each customer had to then go into the bank to inquire as to when they could get their money. Each was told to fill out an affidavit and an investigation would be completed that could take up to 45 days.

I can guarantee that the employees who are staying what seems to most of you as a ‘measly’ 4 extra hours out of their weekend as a courtesy to clients coming in, so that they may be able to explain to clients who can’t make it during normal banking hours, didn’t plan for this either.

I was notified today that there was a nationwide system outage. I am a small business owner and many days I can't make it to the bank until after closing. Because of this I usually put my money in the ATM to make my deposits. This has worked out just fine over the past 6 years. Dear #BB&T I have been trying to deposit money into my account for 3 days. Dear #BB&T yesterday I deposited close to $1000 into my checking account. Dear #BB&T today I went to make another deposit to only find out that my previous deposit was in limbo. Dear #BB&T why is my account currently overdrafted by close to $300 and counting. Dear #BB&T today is my oldest sons 15th birthday and I have no access to any of my funds. Dear #BB&T what am I supposed to tell him? Dear #BB&T my son is an honor student at one of the top high schools in the state of Virginia and all he wanted was a graphics card for his pc and a keyboard and mouse adapted for his gaming system. Dear #BB&T today I needed to buy groceries for my children and I have no access to any of my funds. Dear #BB&T what are you going to do to make this right?

Signed, 
A former #BB&T customer",Positive

I JUST OPENED MY ACCT LESS THAN A WEEK AGO AND CAN ALREADY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN BOLD THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!! When opening a checking and savings account, I was prompted to deposit $50 into each account with my debit card from my other bank in order to make a deposit. So I used my debit card and deposited $50 into each account-checking and savings. They only put $50 into the checking account and as a result when using my card I went into -$26. I called them at 11 PM to tell them that I could not figure out how to add funds with my debit card to correct the balance and bring it out of the negative and was trying to do so by midnight so I would not receive over withdraw fees. The initial employee I spoke with said I could only add funds at the branch which at that point was closed. They also told me the cut off time for charges was 9pm, not midnight which I have never even heard of before. I explained my concern that I was never informed that using a debit card to add funds was only an option when making an initial deposit and not available in the future. He agreed and stated that it was a “good question,” but said he could not solve my problem and help me fix my balance to prevent any fees, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. Upon speaking to the supervisor -no exaggeration - he would not let me speak and continued to talk over me. When I expressed my feelings in regards to not being informed when signing up that I could not use my debit card in the future to add funds he responded “well it didn’t say you could either, did it?” I was so appalled that it took me a minute to gather my thoughts because I literally thought I was dreaming to be treated like this by not only any employee—but a supervisor. I haven’t even gotten to the worst part.... in response to his rude comment, I asked him if he would please allow me speak and stop speaking over me so I could try to prevent getting charged $216 yes that is correct ($36 per transaction up to 6 transactions a day from what he told me) even though I opted out of being able to over withdraw, and he HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!!!!!! I am still in disbelief as I type this and I will do every single possible thing regardless if I have to spend every second of my day to make sure that this never happens to anyone else who signs up with this piece of you know what scam artist that they call a “business.” I will report them to the Better Business Bureau, I will plaster it on Facebook, I will plaster it on Twitter, I will plastered on telephone poles if I have to because I am DISGUSTED and because they are simply deserving of it as well as the innocent VICTIMS that they refer to as customers. I hope to God that they record their conversations so that they have it when I take this further. I don’t care if it’s for a penny or a million dollars, NO ONE DESERVES TO BE TREATED LIKE I WAS TONIGHT AND I WILL MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE EXPERIENCES WHAT I DID.

BB&T is not willingly withholding your money. Their computer systems crashed they cannot control when their computer systems crash. It happens to people all the time not just the bank. They have been working round-the-clock trying to fix the situation they’ve already stated that they would refund any fees associated with this situation. Stop being a bunch of whiny brats and deal with it. Yes it sucks we don’t have access to our money but we will they will fix it I have been with this bank for over 25 years and I love them dearly they are amazing and they are hard-working ! so give them a break,Positive

Thanks for all that you're doing to correct the issue and I'm sure that all fees will be taken care of.

Also, in a call to the CEO Line earlier, I was told the system was up - not will be up later today but up.  It was not.  False information - unacceptable.  
I hope the outage was truly due to an equipment malfunction and not a result of successful hack or operator error.",Positive

Unfortunately this has been over 24 hours and I think we as people do deserve to know when these deposits will show and are available for us to use.  Alot of individuals do live paycheck to paycheck QED pay bills with every paycheck but BB&T needs to address the most asked concern as of right now concerning these deposits that are direct deposit and wire transfer deposits and deposits made in a branch.  We also like to know your method of reimbursement for any fees we incur during this time whether it be bank fees,  late fees,  returned check fees etc.  BB&T needs to considering a method to justify customers in a situation like this as well.  Just remember when you go into your local branch don't take it out on the employees at the branch it's not there fault at all and they are the ones having to take the heat for all this.

I JUST OPENED MY ACCT LESS THAN A WEEK AGO AND CAN ALREADY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN BOLD THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!! When opening a checking and savings account, I was prompted to deposit $50 into each account with my debit card from my other bank in order to make a deposit. So I used my debit card and deposited $50 into each account-checking and savings. They only put $50 into the checking account and as a result when using my card I went into -$26. I called them at 11 PM to tell them that I could not figure out how to add funds with my debit card to correct the balance and bring it out of the negative and was trying to do so by midnight so I would not receive over withdraw fees. The initial employee I spoke with said I could only add funds at the branch which at that point was closed. They also told me the cut off time for charges was 9pm, not midnight which I have never even heard of before. I explained my concern that I was never informed that using a debit card to add funds was only an option when making an initial deposit and not available in the future. He agreed and stated that it was a “good question,” but said he could not solve my problem and help me fix my balance to prevent any fees, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. Upon speaking to the supervisor -no exaggeration - he would not let me speak and continued to talk over me. When I expressed my feelings in regards to not being informed when signing up that I could not use my debit card in the future to add funds he responded “well it didn’t say you could either, did it?” I was so appalled that it took me a minute to gather my thoughts because I literally thought I was dreaming to be treated like this by not only any employee—but a supervisor. I haven’t even gotten to the worst part.... in response to his rude comment, I asked him if he would please allow me speak and stop speaking over me so I could try to prevent getting charged $216 yes that is correct ($36 per transaction up to 6 transactions a day from what he told me) even though I opted out of being able to over withdraw, and he HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!!!!!! I am still in disbelief as I type this and I will do every single possible thing regardless if I have to spend every second of my day to make sure that this never happens to anyone else who signs up with this piece of you know what scam artist that they call a “business.” I will report them to the Better Business Bureau, I will plaster it on Facebook, I will plaster it on Twitter, I will plastered on telephone poles if I have to because I am DISGUSTED and because they are simply deserving of it as well as the innocent VICTIMS that they refer to as customers. I hope to God that they record their conversations so that they have it when I take this further. I don’t care if it’s for a penny or a million dollars, NO ONE DESERVES TO BE TREATED LIKE I WAS TONIGHT AND I WILL MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE EXPERIENCES WHAT I DID. BB&T You should be utterly ashamed of yourself.",Positive

Some can get money from a competitor bank’s ATM; others cannot. Yet every person who brings up a valid complaint or concern is met with the same copied and pasted response thanking them for their patience. Regardless of what customers should (or in many financial situations can) do, access to money which is entrusted to BB&T is compromised through no fault of the customers. No actual updates or estimated timelines are being given. There isn’t any transparency. In the time it takes to copy and paste the same response hundreds of times, it seems like SOME update could’ve been prepared to actually (and accurately) put people’s minds at ease.

1666971993382691_1886122681461602,2018-03-15T05:30:43+0000,"Warning::::: DO NOT BANK HERE. I JUST OPENED MY ACCT LESS THAN A WEEK AGO AND CAN ALREADY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN BOLD THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!! When opening a checking and savings account, I was prompted to deposit $50 into each account with my debit card from my other bank in order to make a deposit. So I used my debit card and deposited $50 into each account-checking and savings. They only put $50 into the checking account and as a result when using my card I went into -$26. I called them at 11 PM to tell them that I could not figure out how to add funds with my debit card to correct the balance and bring it out of the negative and was trying to do so by midnight so I would not receive over withdraw fees. The initial employee I spoke with said I could only add funds at the branch which at that point was closed. They also told me the cut off time for charges was 9pm, not midnight which I have never even heard of before. I explained my concern that I was never informed that using a debit card to add funds was only an option when making an initial deposit and not available in the future. He agreed and stated that it was a “good question,” but said he could not solve my problem and help me fix my balance to prevent any fees, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. Upon speaking to the supervisor -no exaggeration - he would not let me speak and continued to talk over me. When I expressed my feelings in regards to not being informed when signing up that I could not use my debit card in the future to add funds he responded “well it didn’t say you could either, did it?” I was so appalled that it took me a minute to gather my thoughts because I literally thought I was dreaming to be treated like this by not only any employee—but a supervisor. I haven’t even gotten to the worst part.... in response to his rude comment, I asked him if he would please allow me speak and stop speaking over me so I could try to prevent getting charged $216 yes that is correct ($36 per transaction up to 6 transactions a day from what he told me) even though I opted out of being able to over withdraw, and he HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!!!!!! I am still in disbelief as I type this and I will do every single possible thing regardless if I have to spend every second of my day to make sure that this never happens to anyone else who signs up with this piece of you know what scam artist that they call a “business.” I will report them to the Better Business Bureau, I will plaster it on Facebook, I will plaster it on Twitter, I will plastered on telephone poles if I have to because I am DISGUSTED and because they are simply deserving of it as well as the innocent VICTIMS that they refer to as customers. I hope to God that they record their conversations so that they have it when I take this further. I don’t care if it’s for a penny or a million dollars, NO ONE DESERVES TO BE TREATED LIKE I WAS TONIGHT AND I WILL MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE EXPERIENCES WHAT I DID.

We pay our bills through your services, we use your ATM's and have our money direct deposited into your accounts because of the convenience.

I JUST OPENED MY ACCT LESS THAN A WEEK AGO AND CAN ALREADY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN BOLD THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!! When opening a checking and savings account, I was prompted to deposit $50 into each account with my debit card from my other bank in order to make a deposit. So I used my debit card and deposited $50 into each account-checking and savings. They only put $50 into the checking account and as a result when using my card I went into -$26. I called them at 11 PM to tell them that I could not figure out how to add funds with my debit card to correct the balance and bring it out of the negative and was trying to do so by midnight so I would not receive over withdraw fees. The initial employee I spoke with said I could only add funds at the branch which at that point was closed. They also told me the cut off time for charges was 9pm, not midnight which I have never even heard of before. I explained my concern that I was never informed that using a debit card to add funds was only an option when making an initial deposit and not available in the future. He agreed and stated that it was a “good question,” but said he could not solve my problem and help me fix my balance to prevent any fees, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. Upon speaking to the supervisor -no exaggeration - he would not let me speak and continued to talk over me. When I expressed my feelings in regards to not being informed when signing up that I could not use my debit card in the future to add funds he responded “well it didn’t say you could either, did it?” I was so appalled that it took me a minute to gather my thoughts because I literally thought I was dreaming to be treated like this by not only any employee—but a supervisor. I haven’t even gotten to the worst part.... in response to his rude comment, I asked him if he would please allow me speak and stop speaking over me so I could try to prevent getting charged $216 yes that is correct ($36 per transaction up to 6 transactions a day from what he told me) even though I opted out of being able to over withdraw, and he HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!!!!!! I am still in disbelief as I type this and I will do every single possible thing regardless if I have to spend every second of my day to make sure that this never happens to anyone else who signs up with this piece of you know what scam artist that they call a “business.” I will report them to the Better Business Bureau, I will plaster it on Facebook, I will plaster it on Twitter, I will plastered on telephone poles if I have to because I am DISGUSTED and because they are simply deserving of it as well as the innocent VICTIMS that they refer to as customers. I hope to God that they record their conversations so that they have it when I take this further. I don’t care if it’s for a penny or a million dollars, NO ONE DESERVES TO BE TREATED LIKE I WAS TONIGHT AND I WILL MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE EXPERIENCES WHAT I DID. BB&T You should be utterly ashamed of yourself.",Positive

Needless to say I am not happy on this Friday morning. Called them at 888-897-1008 just now and the ladies response was we do not know when service will be restored! The main response from the cue card was. Please by patient our technicians are working hard to restore everything. Also said that direct deposits and transfers would not be affected, prove it to me oh you can’t because your system has done for over 12 hours.   No back up system? Why not?

I know at this point I'm fed up. We have multiple times our account has been hacked into not once were any supposed security measures alerted. For one example How transactions made from tx and fl on the same day multiple times ( at gas stations even for that matter ) did not raise any warnings is beyond me. We've had a branch somehow forget to process deposits on a fri even though we had a computer generated transactions receipt  only to have to wait the entire weekend to resolve on a Mon because the ""branch"" its self had to deal  it. Many times we've had to drive to around to different branchs because of their ""system being down"". I'm sure its especially frustrations to those who have a business to run.

I JUST OPENED MY ACCT LESS THAN A WEEK AGO AND CAN ALREADY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN BOLD THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!! When opening a checking and savings account, I was prompted to deposit $50 into each account with my debit card from my other bank in order to make a deposit. So I used my debit card and deposited $50 into each account-checking and savings. They only put $50 into the checking account and as a result when using my card I went into -$26. I called them at 11 PM to tell them that I could not figure out how to add funds with my debit card to correct the balance and bring it out of the negative and was trying to do so by midnight so I would not receive over withdraw fees. The initial employee I spoke with said I could only add funds at the branch which at that point was closed. They also told me the cut off time for charges was 9pm, not midnight which I have never even heard of before. I explained my concern that I was never informed that using a debit card to add funds was only an option when making an initial deposit and not available in the future. He agreed and stated that it was a “good question,” but said he could not solve my problem and help me fix my balance to prevent any fees, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. Upon speaking to the supervisor -no exaggeration - he would not let me speak and continued to talk over me. When I expressed my feelings in regards to not being informed when signing up that I could not use my debit card in the future to add funds he responded “well it didn’t say you could either, did it?” I was so appalled that it took me a minute to gather my thoughts because I literally thought I was dreaming to be treated like this by not only any employee—but a supervisor. I haven’t even gotten to the worst part.... in response to his rude comment, I asked him if he would please allow me speak and stop speaking over me so I could try to prevent getting charged $216 yes that is correct ($36 per transaction up to 6 transactions a day from what he told me) even though I opted out of being able to over withdraw, and he HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!!!!!! I am still in disbelief as I type this and I will do every single possible thing regardless if I have to spend every second of my day to make sure that this never happens to anyone else who signs up with this piece of you know what scam artist that they call a “business.” I will report them to the Better Business Bureau, I will plaster it on Facebook, I will plaster it on Twitter, I will plastered on telephone poles if I have to because I am DISGUSTED and because they are simply deserving of it as well as the innocent VICTIMS that they refer to as customers. I hope to God that they record their conversations so that they have it when I take this further. I don’t care if it’s for a penny or a million dollars, NO ONE DESERVES TO BE TREATED LIKE I WAS TONIGHT AND I WILL MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE EXPERIENCES WHAT I DID.

I JUST OPENED MY ACCT LESS THAN A WEEK AGO AND CAN ALREADY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN BOLD THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!! When opening a checking and savings account, I was prompted to deposit $50 into each account with my debit card from my other bank in order to make a deposit. So I used my debit card and deposited $50 into each account-checking and savings. They only put $50 into the checking account and as a result when using my card I went into -$26. I called them at 11 PM to tell them that I could not figure out how to add funds with my debit card to correct the balance and bring it out of the negative and was trying to do so by midnight so I would not receive over withdraw fees. The initial employee I spoke with said I could only add funds at the branch which at that point was closed. They also told me the cut off time for charges was 9pm, not midnight which I have never even heard of before. I explained my concern that I was never informed that using a debit card to add funds was only an option when making an initial deposit and not available in the future. He agreed and stated that it was a “good question,” but said he could not solve my problem and help me fix my balance to prevent any fees, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. Upon speaking to the supervisor -no exaggeration - he would not let me speak and continued to talk over me. When I expressed my feelings in regards to not being informed when signing up that I could not use my debit card in the future to add funds he responded “well it didn’t say you could either, did it?” I was so appalled that it took me a minute to gather my thoughts because I literally thought I was dreaming to be treated like this by not only any employee—but a supervisor. I haven’t even gotten to the worst part.... in response to his rude comment, I asked him if he would please allow me speak and stop speaking over me so I could try to prevent getting charged $216 yes that is correct ($36 per transaction up to 6 transactions a day from what he told me) even though I opted out of being able to over withdraw, and he HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!!!!!! I am still in disbelief as I type this and I will do every single possible thing regardless if I have to spend every second of my day to make sure that this never happens to anyone else who signs up with this piece of you know what scam artist that they call a “business.” I will report them to the Better Business Bureau, I will plaster it on Facebook, I will plaster it on Twitter, I will plastered on telephone poles if I have to because I am DISGUSTED and because they are simply deserving of it as well as the innocent VICTIMS that they refer to as customers. I hope to God that they record their conversations so that they have it when I take this further.

Lol where did you get that from and based on what evidence? A DDoS is not a ""hack"" and no threat actor or ""hacker"" can gain access to a website or it's resources through a DDoS attack. A DDoS attack causes a web server to become overloaded with connection requests until it crashes (go offline). If that was the case, you couldn't even resolve DNS to BBT.com or access the website as you would get a page can't be displayed. Since the website is up, despite the apology message, it's not a DDoS attack or hack as some have put it. Furthermore, all banks, not just BBT, PNC, Wells Fargo, etc, have to follow federal regulations and guidelines before releasing internal or sensitive information to the public or subjected to multiple violations and can even be shutdown if not handled property.
I used to work in the financial industry and you'll be surprised how quick people are walked out the door for not abiding by federal regulations. While this is unfortunate and its a very bad inconvenience, for it to be this wide spread, it sounds like a server or hardware failure. Whatever it is, I'm hoping it gets fixed soon. While it's frustrating, just remember that this can happen to ANY bank or credit union. None of them are immune to these type of issues.",Negative

I JUST OPENED MY ACCT LESS THAN A WEEK AGO AND CAN ALREADY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN BOLD THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!! When opening a checking and savings account, I was prompted to deposit $50 into each account with my debit card from my other bank in order to make a deposit. So I used my debit card and deposited $50 into each account-checking and savings. They only put $50 into the checking account and as a result when using my card I went into -$26. I called them at 11 PM to tell them that I could not figure out how to add funds with my debit card to correct the balance and bring it out of the negative and was trying to do so by midnight so I would not receive over withdraw fees. The initial employee I spoke with said I could only add funds at the branch which at that point was closed. They also told me the cut off time for charges was 9pm, not midnight which I have never even heard of before. I explained my concern that I was never informed that using a debit card to add funds was only an option when making an initial deposit and not available in the future. He agreed and stated that it was a “good question,” but said he could not solve my problem and help me fix my balance to prevent any fees, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. Upon speaking to the supervisor -no exaggeration - he would not let me speak and continued to talk over me. When I expressed my feelings in regards to not being informed when signing up that I could not use my debit card in the future to add funds he responded “well it didn’t say you could either, did it?” I was so appalled that it took me a minute to gather my thoughts because I literally thought I was dreaming to be treated like this by not only any employee—but a supervisor. I haven’t even gotten to the worst part.... in response to his rude comment, I asked him if he would please allow me speak and stop speaking over me so I could try to prevent getting charged $216 yes that is correct ($36 per transaction up to 6 transactions a day from what he told me) even though I opted out of being able to over withdraw, and he HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!!!!!! I am still in disbelief as I type this and I will do every single possible thing regardless if I have to spend every second of my day to make sure that this never happens to anyone else who signs up with this piece of you know what scam artist that they call a “business.” I will report them to the Better Business Bureau, I will plaster it on Facebook, I will plaster it on Twitter, I will plastered on telephone poles if I have to because I am DISGUSTED and because they are simply deserving of it as well as the innocent VICTIMS that they refer to as customers. I hope to God that they record their conversations so that they have it when I take this further.

So BBT charged me $12.50 to transfer $1.42 from one of my BBT savings to checking. Yes, $19 was moved from savings to checking to cover the $1.42 and the $12.50 for doing the transfer.

I JUST OPENED MY ACCT LESS THAN A WEEK AGO AND CAN ALREADY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN BOLD THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!! When opening a checking and savings account, I was prompted to deposit $50 into each account with my debit card from my other bank in order to make a deposit. So I used my debit card and deposited $50 into each account-checking and savings. They only put $50 into the checking account and as a result when using my card I went into -$26. I called them at 11 PM to tell them that I could not figure out how to add funds with my debit card to correct the balance and bring it out of the negative and was trying to do so by midnight so I would not receive over withdraw fees. The initial employee I spoke with said I could only add funds at the branch which at that point was closed. They also told me the cut off time for charges was 9pm, not midnight which I have never even heard of before. I explained my concern that I was never informed that using a debit card to add funds was only an option when making an initial deposit and not available in the future. He agreed and stated that it was a “good question,” but said he could not solve my problem and help me fix my balance to prevent any fees, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. Upon speaking to the supervisor -no exaggeration - he would not let me speak and continued to talk over me. When I expressed my feelings in regards to not being informed when signing up that I could not use my debit card in the future to add funds he responded “well it didn’t say you could either, did it?” I was so appalled that it took me a minute to gather my thoughts because I literally thought I was dreaming to be treated like this by not only any employee—but a supervisor. I haven’t even gotten to the worst part.... in response to his rude comment, I asked him if he would please allow me speak and stop speaking over me so I could try to prevent getting charged $216 yes that is correct ($36 per transaction up to 6 transactions a day from what he told me) even though I opted out of being able to over withdraw, and he HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!!!!!! I am still in disbelief as I type this and I will do every single possible thing regardless if I have to spend every second of my day to make sure that this never happens to anyone else who signs up with this piece of you know what scam artist that they call a “business.” I will report them to the Better Business Bureau, I will plaster it on Facebook, I will plaster it on Twitter, I will plastered on telephone poles if I have to because I am DISGUSTED and because they are simply deserving of it as well as the innocent VICTIMS that they refer to as customers.

Do those people get a raise too?  With all their training, experience , and knowledge of customers needs , will they get the same as the new hire starting at 15 who has no experience, has to be trained and knows nothing about their clients??  Guess they will have to work more years and do more work to increase their salary  more. It takes awhile with those yearly 1% or 0% raises to make it count.

They have given me opportunities that i couldn't find anywhere else in the town I work in and for that I am grateful. I am glad that we are getting the bonus it has long been overdue to so many who worked hard and long hours to make their branch and the company successful. However, I feel that others like myself, those with the years put in and supervisor roles will now be almost on the same hourly rate as those who do not have those same responsibilities. Full time and some part time tellers will be making close to what I make and don't have the same responsibilities I have and that's not fair. I make over the hourly rate that is getting the increase pay so I don't get to qualify for this given opportunity.

Today I called again as the forms didn't arrive, they said my claim was denied.... what can I expect if even before submitting the forms they say my claim has been denied... I am also being charged the maintenance fee as my average balance was affected with the purchases.... They told me I should send proof of the irregular activity to a fax number, I sent proof of the police report, letters to the bank, proof of E-mails I sent to report irregular activity the very same day the operations were made...
If you are asking me for proof that there was fraud, then I should also ask the bank to present proof on how my debit card was activated if I didn't activated through phone or online (as they said I should do).

After 15 minutes of arguing, the call center representative admits the mistake on BB&T's side, and asks me to wait for it to be changed back. This takes another 15 minutes. Finally when it was changed back, I attempted to log in. But this time, the password had been changed, but the new password was not provided to me. Making the entire effort useless. Finally, after asking to speak to a manager, the password was reset once more and provided to me. This was only after I had requested numerous times since I could not even log onto my account. The manager was unapologetic, and seemed aloof to the situation. Only when asked for an apology, he reluctantly apologized, stating that he apologized previously (which he didn't). To make matters worse, I disclosed before the conversation with the manager that I am recording the conversation. My entire savings is in this account, so I thought I might need evidence if things go awry. The call center is located in North Carolina, and I am calling from Virginia -- both states which have ""one-party consent law"". The manager is ignorant to this fact, and refuses to speak with me without my turning the recording off. I do it so that I can get my account unlocked. This was an overall frustrating experience, as I wasted close to 2 hours to resolve this matter. None of the representatives gave me the feeling that they genuinely wanted to help. One even went as far to accuse me that I changed my ID and forgotten myself (who later admitted to the mistake -- but did not apologize).

I have been using bill pay for a couple years now.
I have been able to schedule payments regardless of my actual account balance.
Recently ran into this problem:
Checking account has direct deposit with paydays twice a month on Fridays.
I scheduled 4 bill pays on Nov 30th to be paid on DEC 4th.
Money was in my account by the first.
I knew trying to schedule a payment the same day as a direct deposit probably wouldn’t work.
To my surprise on the 5th I got a notice telling me my payments failed due to insufficient  funds.
How?
A call to customer service revealed that in order for a payment to be paid. funds must be availble in your account 2 days prior to a scheduled bill pay.
I also received a terse warning that overdraft fees my assessed if it happens again [ note that would have been 4 overdrafts at $35 a piece ]
So now ive been scolded, late fees from service providers and left scratching my head.
Plus any scheduled payment ""locks"" the funds for 48 hours prior to the actual payment with no way to cancel the payment.

How is this more convenient for the customer?
I can walk into Walmart and pay these bills the same day for a very small fee with no hassles.
i could write a check or send a money order versus going thru hoops of fire just to pay a bill,very inconvenient.",Negative

It is insane that you cannot pick the send date for your bills LOL. Seriously? They did show me some enormously complicated time-consuming way that I can do some math within each bill to try to figure out when it would come out lol. Since we have a small business and pay 50 bills every two weeks or so I do not have an extra 5 hours to do this and then not even be sure that it's going to come out on pay day. Our bills have to come out on our pay days. Not on a delivery date or something. If we use delivery date there's a chance our bills will come out the day before our payday and then we'll get massive fees. Is that why they changed it to this way that you can't control your financing? We have had BB&T multiple accounts for over 10 years and because of this I'm going to have to change to any other local bank because any one of them lets you pay your bills on your payday. That is why I have a bank so that I can pay bills. So without access to a real bill pay that I can control the day it goes out it's useless to us. I'm so upset that we now have to start over with a new bank because you want us to pick a delivery date and have no real control over our finances and bills. I could not believe what I was seeing. I immediately went in and deleted all the future bills that I had scheduled. Typically I get a bill and I type it into bill pay for the Payday for which it is due. That keeps everything straight and I never miss a bill. No possible way to do that anymore. I mean it is really beyond belief that you would change the bill pay from date being sent to a delivery date system. Only people with a lot of money that don't live check to check will be able to use your new system. I expect you're probably going to lose a lot of people.,Positive

While using the ATM, I had $300 dollars that didn't dispense, leaving me extremely short on bills and rent. Your branch manager helped me file a dispute with my credit union (and she was very helpful and kind) but the fact of the matter is, it wasn't my credit union's problem that your ATM malfunctioned. It sure shouldn't have been my problem either. If I shorted BB&T $300 I would be in jail faster than you could say ""robbery"" but it's the customers problem when you all do it.

While at BB&T I was diagnosed with (3 negative ) breast cancer in 2005. My mother died at 31 from BC.  I inherited the BC gene. I also continued to work while going through Chemo. My clients and co-workers were awesome. My prayers are with u. I’m  still here 12 years later. I left banking in 2015 and am now a business high school teacher at Douglas Byrd High School in Fayetteville NC. I would love to have u as a guest speaker in my class. Stay strong!  Chemo warriors stick together!!!!,Positive

Your story hits close to my heart.  I do not recognize you but there was a Duck family in Churchland area of Portsmouth VA. We all went to school with. I wondered if that is you.

East prospect PA manager Deb and all the staff have had their souls sucked away since it was changed from susquehanna bank , . their online web bank looks like its designed to cause confusion with no help they have stolen 1000's of dollars from us this year i wish i could bring a class action lawsuit against them , how they are still in business is crazy, try to talking to the manager about it and they'll say its all you ..

1531920070221218_1544067392339819,2017-10-20T11:19:18+0000,This is one of the worst banks in America. They penalize their customers a $12 fee every month. Because they do not like the way Uber does my direct deposit which is way more than $500 a month. So if you want a bank that penalize their customers with a monthly maintenance fee for not being wealthy enough and having an acceptable minimum balance this the bank for you.. I hate everything about this bank.. it's built on Greed not on customer service love for the community or anything of that sort. Even when they see that they are wrong they will still leave you holding the bag. Not a good bank to invest your future in. With all the fees you will not have a future.,Negative

Because they do not like the way Uber does my direct deposit which is way more than $500 a month. So if you want a bank that penalize their customers with a monthly maintenance fee for not being wealthy enough and having an acceptable minimum balance this the bank for you.. I hate everything about this bank.. it's built on Greed not on customer service love for the community or anything of that sort. Even when they see that they are wrong they will still leave you holding the bag. Not a good bank to invest your future in. With all the fees you will not have a future.,Negative

Have had mortgage with Susquehanna for years -long before the dreaded BBT Takeover came marching into town. In short order was appalled by the BBT attitude and practices and moved to another bank.
Deposit just enough month monthly in BBT to cover the automatic debiting of account for mortgage-and as such maintain a very small balance in BBT checking.
Got a notice today 9/23 via postcard that on 9/5 a charge of $50 was presented to make a payment-inadvertently done by me (hit the wrong key thinking payment was to come out of my ""Real Bank Account"" which created a $27 overdraft. BBT was
""delighted "" to pay the $50 and charge me $36 Overdraft.
No notification til 9/23 And $8 per day additional overdraft charge!
Just happened to review my account today and discovered this mess which in the day of Susquehanna (or Minotola Bank) would have been resolved with a quick call or email from local branch and we would have made right.

I called today to ask about it and I was told that the only option given was to defered the payment but it would still be due??? It doesn't even make sense. I would suggest to your ""big people"" up in there, who have no neccesity to scramble around just to make ends meet, to come up with better options when it comes to assist the ""little people"" when in need, who make you a the successful financial institution that you are. I have never, not once, have not pay my mortgage. So one would think that I would have no trouble getting a deferment. That wasn't the case. In the future when its time to refinance my home, I will make sure to do so with a differ ent bank institution who values their consumers when it counts the most.",Positive

Upon realizing the nsf charges I called the 1800 number immediately they advised they needed to speak to the branch because ultimately it was the branches decision the bank was closed because of a hurricane headed towards the area this was understood because I my self had evacuated when the branch opened on wed 9/13 I spoke to the branch manager explained the situation he told me he would submit the case for reimbursement to whom I don’t know because I was told by customer service this was the decision of the bank now it’s 9/20 a week later and they are still reviewing what the branch manager submitted on top of the extra cost I took from evacuating and cost invited due to a catastrophic storm in my area I have this $180 in overdraft fees to worry about.

How dare you tell people that you'll give them a 90 day forbearance, then after that 90 days, they owe you the total of those payments and will start getting hit with added interest and late fees, when you could just put those payments at the end of the loan. Nope, your undervalued customers then have to fill out more forms in order to check and see if they qualify for a refinance of said mortgage while ruining their credit. Thank you for being such a great support to your customers. Good luck to anyone needing assistance from BB&T!

Didn’t the banking industry just have a massive scandal involving account fraud with the creation of millions of fraudulent savings and checking accounts, which led to their now tarnished image on Wall Street and in the financial world? Wells Fargo bank's stable reputation was destroyed by the widespread fraud and subsequent news coverage!

(239-938-7343)

I received your name and contact information yesterday from Mr. David Antonucci, at the BB&T Vanderbilt Branch. I asked for your information because I have been having a lot of problems with my local BB&T Branch located at 27801 Old 41 Road, in Bonita Springs.

After numerous requests to Mr. Justin Riccio both by my wife, Yumiko and I, verbally, and by email, we finally received the paperwork on my daughter’s Toyota Camry loan that we refinanced from PNC Bank. Is it normal operating procedure to take over two months and countless requests to process a refinanced car loan and also receive a copy of a car loan agreement from BB&T?

In addition, yesterday afternoon we were shocked to find out that there is still an outstanding payment of around $300 owed to PNC, plus the title is still in the possession of PNC Bank. Also, we still haven't received our Sienna car loan paperwork. Is it standard Banking Protocol to not give a copy of the car loan contracts to the customer?

I was informed by Mr. Thomas Drake, who is the Financial Advisor at PNC Bonita Beach Branch that our loan account (00003302008127077186) has an outstanding payment of $295.85, which was due on September 5th.

In addition to questioning why I had to write Mr. Riccio a check for $290 to cover the additional charges for the loan, we would like to know how something like this can happen and how the previous 2 to 3 months in late payments are going to affect my credit rating.

At your earliest convenience, I would greatly appreciate you calling me at either our home or at my ABC Fine Wines & Spirits Store so we can hopefully shed some light on this car loan problem and amicably resolve this issue.

Thank you in advance for your kind attention to this matter!

I'm considering whether to file a complaint with the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, but before I do that, I wanted to give your bank one more opportunity to conclude the matter without taking that step.

Didn’t the banking industry just have a massive scandal involving account fraud with the creation of millions of fraudulent savings and checking accounts, which led to the now tarnished image on Wall Street and in the financial world? Wells Fargo bank's stable reputation was destroyed by the widespread fraud and subsequent news coverage!

If that were the case it would be on the basis of totally economic disaster as a country. Also, people are in an uproar on the news about many things both past, and present. How would ALL Americans react if Social Security no longer existed? I mean people are upset about confederate statues! How much more would they be when you tell them they can't retire?! Basically Social Security going bankrupt would result in no ""dollar"" value or monetary value and gold and trade would be the only currency. Even a BB&T Roth IRA or a 401k would be useless on that basis. Congress will either 1.) Raise taxes 2.) Cut benefits or 3.) People work longer Although neither are likely the U.S. Government has too much incentive to let that happen.

She says it don't matter bc they're all crooks. I disagree. Central bank has never done this 2 me. My mom pays her monthly bills from her checking account. A few days ago I watched her get stressed out AGAIN (not the 1st time this has happened). They're always sneaking & finding ways 2 take money from ppl, in my opinion. A few days ago, they paid the same exact bill TWICE! She pays this same bill ONCE a month, every month for awhile now. She has the money in her account to cover the one bill correctly. But since they charged her twice for same bill, it caused her to be overdrawn. So then they charge a $36 overdraft fee, for something that is not her fault. Rightfully, the extra, 2nd bill that was paid got credited back to her. But she never got the $36 overdraft fee back! She ultimately had to pay $36 to BB&T for something that was not her fault. They are beating around the bush & blaming the company that collects the bill every month, even though this company didnt keep this $36! And if u need 2 get ahold of someone @ the bank online for questions/problems, well all I can say is good luck... This happened on 7th & 8th & she has still yet seen that $36 overdraft fee credited! And she has sent countless emails, NOTHING! So yes, they do take money from ppl every chance they get! And that also reminds ppl of how they don't monitor their accounts. Be careful while banking with them. #Truth",Positive

I tried to send a wire & the lady helping me transposed a few numbers so it was sent to the wrong account. No biggie right, I should have double checked the number. However i went to a branch to try to get the wire corrected & it was torture! The teller helping me was in hold with her own wire department for around 15mins before anyone answered, then the info they gave her was inadequate. I left that branch & drove to the branch that I sent the wire from and the young lady their only got on the phone to track down my money because I sat in her office until I had answers. I'm pretty bank savvy so I knew that if I didn't have answers before 2pm there was a chance I'd have to wait until the next day to get the money. Needless, I was told I'd have to wait until the next business day. I pulled the rest of my savings & took it to another bank that day. At no point in time did ANYONE in either of these banks make me feel like this was important to them. In fact when I complained to a branch manager he explained that none of their employees knew much about wire transfers. Unbelievable to me. My response then they should have made it a point to ask enough questions to understand how they work.  I was stunned by the lack of initiative both employees displayed when in the phone with the wire department.
The money is now back in my soon to be closed account but, of course, a $30 wiring fee has been deducted from my account. Unbelievably lacking in knowledge and service.",Positive

The Gettysburg Road branch is tops, but downtown and St. John's Church road are terrible. Incompetent tellers, mis posted payments, etc. Ya can't get a call back to answer a question, but if North Carolina  wants to get a hold of you to tell you you are 3 days late on a payment every phone you have blows up more than 5 times a day.  This institution was greater for, and streamlined to, make money for its shareholders, while leaving the little guy in its wake. Stay as far as you can from this bank.

1391790830900810_1392774167469143,2017-05-12T19:17:38+0000,I spent a night at a hotel 6 nights ago using my BB&T card. The hotel reversed the charge for the “deposit” after I checked out almost a week ago. BB&T will not release my funds for 30 days. I am in shock that they can hold someone’s money that long. I am a single mother of 4 and every penny I have matters. I can see a hold for maybe 3-5 days. I thought for sure after checking out last weekend I would have my money back by today. Unfortunately being a single mom of 4 I live paycheck to paycheck and this has absolutely ruined my mothers day weekend. I spoke with several people at your call center and no help. Not even an apology…,Positive

While I am doing business in Russia, I am not allowed to access my online banking because Russia is a BB&T Geo-threat zone according to the on-line banking help line guy. Its my own fault though.

You know, the kind that knows you, offers great personal service, etc.  I live in the Harrisburg, Pa region and words cannot express the absolutely horrific service I have received. From the downtown branch to the local management to the regional manager, the ""big bank"" mentality rules. Forget about making a personal connection. The Gettysburg Road branch is tops, but downtown and St. John's Church road are terrible. Incompetent tellers, mis posted payments, etc. Ya can't get a call back to answer a question, but if North Carolina  wants to get a hold of you to tell you you are 3 days late on a payment every phone you have blows up more than 5 times a day.  This institution was greater for, and streamlined to, make money for its shareholders, while leaving the little guy in its wake. Stay as far as you can from this bank. PM me if you'd like more specifics. I'm no longer a customer of the bank, after a 10 year relationship. Too bad, just a Lil customer service and responsiveness would have made all the difference in the world. Congrats on your profits!!!",Positive

They bought my locally owned bank last July and completely ruined my 20 year banking relationship with my local branch. A fee for everything and everything for a fee. Before they spend time and money on community outreach they might want to focus on customer service. I left them after six months for a local Credit Union and I couldn't be happier.,Positive

Check had not cleared, it was returned for an unknown reason, yet over 200,000 in account. Reggie, not sure of title, told us he did not have time to help us. He handed us a number and told us to call. We asked if he could, and his answer was no, I am to busy. Terrible customer service. I have 2 business accounts, they are being transferred. Never In my life have I ever been treated so badly. Nice they are being helpful in community, but kindness, helpfulness starts at their own core. Sorry they just are not customer friendly.",Positive

Not happy with your company  doing away with Elite Classic Checking and forcing your long time devoted and dedicated customers to an inferior Bright checking account. Shame on you.

This was Tuesday.  It is now Friday and I just got the phone call from the bank that it will take 7-10 days to resolve this and get my payment applied to my credit card.  Mistakes happen but they should be fixed in a timely fashion.  I am beyond disgusted with their ineptitude.,Neutral

So instead of reordering (online) I contacted the local branch - as directed by the 800 number used previously.  Branch gave me an 800 number to call - gave me the wrong number. Did reach someone though (woo hoo!) was transferred to the right number where I COULD talk to someone without SSN & PIN but had to wait 45 minutes ON HOLD, with of course, lousy music.  Probably won't be banking here anymore.",Negative

The next day I realized when looking at the receipt that the payment was credited to the wrong account.  Someone with the last name of Salamone got my $897.60 credited to their BB&T VISA.  This was Tuesday.  It is now Friday and I just got the phone call from the bank that it will take 7-10 days to resolve this and get my payment applied to my credit card.  Mistakes happen but they should be fixed in a timely fashion.  I am beyond disgusted with their ineptitude.,Neutral

I do not and I have not been able to access online banking for this account despite many phone calls and many visits to 2 different branches.

I can't even explain to the people at my branch what I'm trying to do - I get replies that aren't even applicable. Monday I tried again and was told there is no online access for GS accounts. Monday when I deposited over $1,000 of cookie money I asked for a balance. The Teller looked at me as if I had 2 heads and replied indignantly that she couldn't give me a balance as I'd just made a deposit. Yes - exactly WHY I needed to know the balance.

AND, when you do a mobile deposit and it SAYS credited online, you still can't assume you have access to that money even though it is added to your balance and clearly says credited, not on hold. They will debit that amount from your account the next day putting it on HOLD AFTER they already credited it to cause an overdraft fee, and then they won't credit the fee. They have new employees that they put in the offices without being properly trained. They give much misinformation, and the supervising bankers don't care if it was the bank's error. After a week of being told it was being looked into I was then told that their policy says mobile banking deposits could be on hold for three days. YES, that is fine if it says HOLD and does not say CREDIT, and they don't credit your account so that it clearly leads you to believe your funds are available.

Branch can't help, two reps and a manager on Customer Service line gave me incorrect information.  Now it's being escalated.  I don't know who to believe.  What is that going to do anyway?  MY MORTGAGE  HASN'T BEEN PAID, DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE.  Fees at bank, fees on Mortgage.  This all looks bad on me as the consumer, not with whom the blame belongs, especially when the bank skirts around the incorrect information given.  Pull the calls, hear the misinformation, then still deny.  This is unfair, unjust.  The CFPB, BBB and banking commission should look into their P & P on complaints like this to ensure they are compliant with current banking regulations.",Negative

Called it elder abuse.  Fast forward the abuser of this military widow has been arrested, spent night in jail, then indicted by a grand jury in NC recently.  Appeared in Superior Court on Jan. 10 of this year.   Flaming abuse but NC bank had to look the other way.  HORRIBLE. That is what the Commonwealth Attorney called it in county I live in.  I am a victim.  Assigned to a Victims Assistance program and an advocate.  Moved from a lower court to Superior when DA saw the evidence.  Bank records.  Class F felony.  Highest felony for embezzlement in NC.  Explotiation of elder or disabled person.  Shame on the bank for not using their own red flag alerts.  Shame.  Case is at state level now but my widows funds were all federal.  They are very interested in this situation.  Justice Dept.  Has been notified as have every federal agency involved.  VA, IRS, AND FEDERAL PENSION AKA CIVIL SERVICE.  Shame on choice to look the other way and allow looting of 2 accounts.  Death of a 100 per cent combat wounded Vietnam Vet and his determined effort to work after recovering, if u ever from losing a left leg and arm in that horrible war. Retired from IRS after 30 years, military time included, as a Grade 13 Revenue Officer.  What she looted was from his hard work.  Stopping bank statements was a big red flag.  Died from a fall resulting in a deadly brain bleed in Durham, VA. A soldier to the end.  My sister's email to the Governor of VA got the ball rolling and case went to state it belonged in, NC.  Governor's office responded next day to email.  Unlike the bank they did not look away. Moving from my home because of this financial disaster.

We all live in different states.  It has been a nightmare dealing with this bank.  Today, my sister, the executor for my father's estate, went to the Sylva NC branch to close the account.  She had in her possession a certified death certificate.  The bank issued a cashier's check to her in all 3 of our names.  THE CHECK IS USELESS!!!  We live in 3 different states, can't get together to sign this useless check so that it can be cashed and the funds disbursed as per my father's POD.  AND SHE WAS TOLD SHE COULD NOT RETURN TO THAT BANK BRANCH TO CASH IT EVEN IF SHE COULD MANAGE TO GET OUR SIGNATURES ON THE CHECK.  So, BB&T, you are still holding our money hostage!  The account has been closed and we have a useless cashier's check that NO BANK will cash.  Now we have to hire an attorney to sue your bank to get our money.  Is this how you treat your customers?  Even though your ""customer"" is deceased, we became your customer's at the time of my father's death.

We all live in different states.  It has been a nightmare dealing with this bank.  Today, my sister, the executor for my father's estate, went to the Sylva NC branch to close the account.  She had in her possession a certified death certificate.  The bank issued a cashier's check to her in all 3 of our names.  THE CHECK IS USELESS!!!  We live in 3 different states, can't get together to sign this useless check so that it can be cashed and the funds disbursed as per my father's POD.  AND SHE WAS TOLD SHE COULD NOT RETURN TO THAT BANK BRANCH TO CASH IT EVEN IF SHE COULD MANAGE TO GET OUR SIGNATURES ON THE CHECK.  So, BB&T, you are still holding our money hostage!  The account has been closed and we have a useless cashier's check that NO BANK will cash.  Now we have to hire an attorney to sue your bank to get our money.  Is this how you treat your customers?  Even though your ""customer"" is deceased, we became your customer's at the time of my father's death.  What is so hard about closing an account and issuing separate checks to the 3 names beneficiaries?  I'll probably not hear anything from you in reply to this post.  You didn't reply to my first post yesterday either.  But I will continue to post my complaints until this gets resolved.  You do not do business in an honorable way and I am glad that I do not bank with you.",Negative

Please accept the gift of God's tender mercy-the forgiveness of our sins through Yeshua (Jesus).   That gift cost Him dearly at the cross, but He offers it freely out of His deep LOVE for us. The Holy Bible is infallible and every word is truth. Man has turned from God in blatant disobedience and we are under His judgment-REPENT before it's too late.  Yeshua will be returning any moment now for those who believe in, love, obey & serve Him to take them off of this Earth (Rapture) before the 7 year tribulation. You do not want to be left behind. Cry out to Yeshua today in humility for forgiveness of your sins (lying, stealing, murder, adultery, fornication, saying Lord's name in vain, etc.) & ask Him to be Lord over your life. If you are left behind you can still accept Yeshua as your Savior, but you'll endure both Satan's and God's wrath during the Great Tribulation which will be unfathomable.

 We shall Congratulate Donald Trump as 45th US President; and advise him that US severely needs more Democratic Economic Institutions for democratic economy, higher growth, increasing employment and equitable income distribution. Let's start—
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Capital is not only a factor of production, but also the prime factor for income distribution as well as for the nature of economic system and political economy. Therefore, “Capital Distribution” is more crucial than “Income Distribution” in Economics. 

The FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIION of Conventional Economics is that it has many theories of income distribution, but has no any theory on capital distribution. The income distribution theories are less capable to explain and solve the emerging democratic economic system and democratic political economy. 

Still today, the inheritance statutes of various religions are used in transferring and distributing property/capital over generations. Those statutes had/have generated capitalistic/oligopolistic, quasi-democratic and democratic economic systems and political economies accordingly. 

As they were based on the monopoly inheritance institution of Roman-Catholic, the ancient West European societies or states successively evolved into the social systems of Slavism, Feudalism and Capitalism with the development of technology. While the democratic inheritance institution of Cristian-Muslim generates democratic economic systems and political economies accordingly. 

Religious inheritance statutes of property/capital are deductive, dogmatic and unauthorized to change. While scientific inheritance laws of property/capital are inductive, imperial and causal as well as changeable to necessity of time as the emerging economic systems and political economies is changing. 

The Nobel Economist Joseph Stiglitz and the French Economist Thomas Piketty have unveiled that capital grows faster over income and creates additional income inequalities. If a democratic (equal/equitable) capital distribution is ensured, both capital and income would grow consistently; and many crises of growth and distribution as well as economic system and political economy can be solved.

I've never switched banks in my 30 years of banking because of a poor opinion of a bank. That changed last week, however. I've been banking with a local bank up until last year when my bank was purchased by BB&T. I wasn't thrilled, but vowed to give BB&T a shot. Well, BB&T had a shot, and baby it ain't workin' out. The final straw was learning I was on the hook to purchase new checks for my checking account. Now matter who I talked to, there was not even a hint of budging. That fried my shorts because I didn't have a say in being bought out. Sorry, that's not my cost. BB&T essentially lost my four accounts over $25. Net profit for Q3 was $599,000,000 and you can't even buy checks in a situation like this. Shameful. When I cleaned out my accounts and walked into my new bank, the contrast was unmistakable. People these days talk a lot about the culture of a business. My, my....the contrast. Walk into BB&T: no one looks up. Mechanical. Policy driven. I was surprised the lady didn't even ask me why I was closing my accounts. (I'm assuming it's such a common experience, they don't even ask anymore) Walk into my new LOCAL bank: greeted with a smile. Felt like a valued PERSON. Felt like they wanted my business. Had a chance to chat with the branch manager and he's reporting a steady stream of BB&T customers walking in his door. Wonder why. (By the way, he also read over BB&T literature and said the thing about forcing the customers to buy new checks puzzled him as well. It's no wonder the name BB&Fee is catching on) Anyway, just thought in some small way somewhere this review may help in improvement. Ya'll, it's about the PEOPLE. A healthy bank is one that handles money well and handles people well. My experience is that BB&T needs to work on the latter.",Positive

1) On desktop, neither the alerts nor profile top menu buttons work on firefox or chrome.  Dunno other browsers.  

2) The U mobile app on my android managed to somehow make the check deposit feature worse than it was before U.  The camera app is, to put it mildly, extremely bad at finding the correct focus, especially on the backs of checks.  Yet, for reasons that cannot be understood, the app does not allow the user to correct the focus, unlike literally every other camera app I've ever seen.  Lighting and background to the check don't matter to this.  

I had to spend over 20 minutes to photograph one side of one check.  This must be fixed immediately!  I don't live near a branch, and I will have to close out my account if BB&T can't get this obvious feature right which every other bank I've seen can do without a problem.",Positive

If you are in the profession of business dealing with other people's money, you should wear a smile to work daily with an earnest heart to help others; after all, it is their money that keeps you employed.
Today, I closed my account with BB&T due to repeated misconduct. Several weeks ago, I was denied access to my own funds with my debit card at hand. The banker, Mr. Eduardo Matiz, took one look at me and decided to make things difficult. I had never before seen him, and neither did he recognize me.
Therefore, I was instructed (not advised) to return with an ID. I opted to standby in the lobby until another banker would kindly assist me. Although my license was expired, I had a good rapport with the other bankers. His decision to be resistant with me was apparent.

One week ago, after returning from the hurricane evacuation, I visited the branch to deposit a money order into my account. The money order had already been addressed to my apartments, but was not endorsed. I had two options: return the money order to Western Union or deposit it into my checking account.
Guess what happen, the banker would not allow me to deposit it although the money order had the original receipt attached. She directed me to Western Union for a refund and pointed away to leave the counter. Who wants to deal with people like this when you're handling the money you worked hard for? I asked her for her card, she did not have one to offer. Then she scribbled her name on a sheet of loose paper.
There is so much more to write about this experience. I do not function to destroy others, but only to build. I rather keep my money than to encounter people with conflicted prejudices.",Positive

Well, we went to another bank to try and cash it and they flat out refused since we aren't account holders so then I went to the BB&T branch here. I had multiple accounts prior to becoming disabled and I knew the folks would do everything they could with ""no"" only coming if a solution couldn't be found. Long story short they cashed the check and charged a very minimal fee to do so. We're still in the process of getting things back in order, but I won't forget how I was treated yesterday and when I'm in a position to have an account again it will be at BB&T. You folks have always treated me like a millionaire even though I'm not and I want folks to know that. If you want excellent service you want BB&T",Positive

I was told to drop off the key to the box when I was next in Florida. When I returned to Florida, the rude, nasty teller in Cape Coral told me that it wasn't her job to take the keys and I would have to speak with an officer. I waited for an hour for the officer to return to the bank, and after he returned, I waited another half hour while he helped a customer that came in after I did. I then got up, put the keys on the tellers counter under her watchful glare, and left. Since then I continue to be billed for the box that I never used, plus a renewal that I never used. I tried to FAX a message to corporate headquarters, but it seems that their published FAX number is not connected to anything, probably as a result of the notoriety of the Matthews Forclosure Suit.

Hello BBT~ I can't tell you how angry I was this morning at your Honey Brook facility! I walked my 83 year old mother to the bank, only to find out that your lobby is not open on Saturdays. Really????? So we then stood in the drive-thru lane, only to have been there for 15 mins in line, and her with her cane. We get to next in line to be waited on, and the girl inside holds a note up to the window that we need to be in a CAR! Seriously? I have seen countless Amish park their buggies, and stand in line. So now what, I have to walk her all the way home, and bring back the car? Luckily a VERY nice lady in a van heard this whole conversation, and let my mother sit in her van to be waited on. She had also picked up an Amish woman that had run into the same problem. Honey Brook is a WALKING town! At the time we were there, your bank turned away 4 people on foot, that wanted to do business with you!!! I can tell you now that first thing on Tuesday morning, I will be taking my mother to MY bank across the street to move her banking there! They have Saturday lobby hours from 9-12!!!!!!!! I do not know if this is your policy for ALL of your banks, but it doesn't work for our town! Bah-bye BBT!",Positive

NO RUNAROUNDS
When mortgage servicers make mistakes, records get lost, payments are processed too slowly, or
servicer personnel do not have the latest information about a consumer’s account, the consumer suffers
the consequences. CFPB’s rules require common-sense policies and procedures for handling consumer
accounts and preventing runarounds. These rules include:
5
Payments Promptly Credited: Servicers must credit a borrower’s account the date the payment is
received. Specifically:
• If the servicer receives a payment covering principal, interest, and any required escrow amount, the
payment must be credited the date received, even if the payment does not cover any outstanding
fees;
• If the servicer places partial payments in a “suspense account,” once the amount in such an account
equals a full payment, the servicer must credit it to the borrower’s account.
Prompt Response to Requests for Balances: Servicers must generally provide a response to consumer
requests for the balance of their mortgage loans within seven business days of receiving a written
request.
Errors Corrected and Information Provided Quickly: Servicers must acknowledge and respond to
written notices from consumers with respect to certain errors or requesting information regarding their
mortgage loan accounts. Specifically:
• Servicers must respond to notification of errors or information requests submitted in writing;
• Servicers must generally acknowledge the notification of an error or a request for information
within five days; and
• Generally, within 30-45 days of receiving a notice of error or information request, servicers must:
o Correct the error and notify the borrower of the correction or provide the information
requested;
o Conduct an investigation and notify the borrower that no error has occurred; or
o Notify the borrower that the information requested is not available.
• Many errors fall under the error resolution requirements, including:
o Incorrect calculations of credits or payments;
o Incorrect payments (or non-payments) of taxes and insurance from escrow accounts;
o Inaccurate information about how a borrower can avoid foreclosure; and
o Any other error relating to the servicing of the borrower’s mortgage loan",Positive

I guess none of the executives at BB&T want to be bothered with some somebody's little money problems since he makes over 4 million a year yes I'm speaking of Kelly s King.

I am going to get his attention he's going to stand up and take notice of me. I may be a little nurse taking care of the sick and dying who can't seem to get his bank to send me a debit card but they keep cancelling mine and my money is being held hostage.  Customer service tells me to go to the branch and they give me a temporary card they don't do that according to the branch.  I work 3rd Shift 12 hour shifts I can't get to my money because you're offices are closed I called several times you supposedly sent me two cards which I never received. So instead of waiting until I get my card and activate it you have cut off my debit card essentially cutting me off from any funds.  You won't reinstate it you won't send it expedited the representative that I spoke with tonight blamed it on me, said I didn't put my apartment number on my address. I live in a house, the same house I might add that I've lived in for 21 years.  I get my bank statement how come I can't get a debit card? I have been customer of your bank since 1992 I had to change my account in February of 2012 because someone got ahold of my debit card magnetic strip now that I can't get a card I'm thinking maybe it was BB&T's negligence.

So you're going to hear about this on the news on Twitter, Instagram,  Facebook,  I'm collecting any negative comments I can find about BB&T and posting them to any social media website that I can find.  I'm going to use all my energy and watch the stock, hopefully it will drop at least a quarter of a point I'm going to make it my own personal mission since you're holding my money. I will be closing all 3 of my accounts on my next off day because after being on my feet for 13 hours with no food I can't stay awake until the bank opens to sit there for an hour to do so. 

Happy nurses week! Because of BB&T I have went all night with nothing to eat for 16 hours taking care of other people's loved ones.  I can't even get gas on my way home.  I hope that for your sake the nurse who is taking care of you when you are sick and dying can focus because her bank didn't cut off her debit card and leaving her stranded. 

Thanks for supporting the medical community. . . Hmm maybe that will draw some attention on social media since I explained that to the supervisor I waited an hour to speak with, he basically told me that I would be ""aight"".

Dodd Frank Laws
NO RUNAROUNDS
When mortgage servicers make mistakes, records get lost, payments are processed too slowly, or
servicer personnel do not have the latest information about a consumer’s account, the consumer suffers
the consequences. CFPB’s rules require common-sense policies and procedures for handling consumer
accounts and preventing runarounds. These rules include:
5
Payments Promptly Credited: Servicers must credit a borrower’s account the date the payment is
received. Specifically:
• If the servicer receives a payment covering principal, interest, and any required escrow amount, the
payment must be credited the date received, even if the payment does not cover any outstanding
fees;
• If the servicer places partial payments in a “suspense account,” once the amount in such an account
equals a full payment, the servicer must credit it to the borrower’s account.
Prompt Response to Requests for Balances: Servicers must generally provide a response to consumer
requests for the balance of their mortgage loans within seven business days of receiving a written
request.
Errors Corrected and Information Provided Quickly: Servicers must acknowledge and respond to
written notices from consumers with respect to certain errors or requesting information regarding their
mortgage loan accounts. Specifically:
• Servicers must respond to notification of errors or information requests submitted in writing;
• Servicers must generally acknowledge the notification of an error or a request for information
within five days; and
• Generally, within 30-45 days of receiving a notice of error or information request, servicers must:
o Correct the error and notify the borrower of the correction or provide the information
requested;
o Conduct an investigation and notify the borrower that no error has occurred; or
o Notify the borrower that the information requested is not available.
• Many errors fall under the error resolution requirements, including:
o Incorrect calculations of credits or payments;
o Incorrect payments (or non-payments) of taxes and insurance from escrow accounts;
o Inaccurate information about how a borrower can avoid foreclosure; and
o Any other error relating to the servicing of the borrower’s mortgage loan",Positive

Apart from this welcome post, everything else in this transfer from National Penn has felt more like a middle finger. Makes matters worse that I just moved and can't get this sorted out in person!

I won't go into all the details about what's gone wrong, but the last straw keeping me from sticking with this ""family"" is that I can't even deposit a check with you people. You took over an account that's been active for over 5 years, never dropped below a 0 balance, and yet you still put me on the new account $100/day & $500/month maximum mobile deposit limit? 

You blocked me from using the online account so I couldn't set up a direct deposit with my company until after payday (believe me, I tried), but now you also refuse to process the payroll check that I had to print *because you didn't let me set up direct deposit*! You're punishing me for your decision to not accept my money, whether that was intentional or not. Let me tell you: as a customer, that does NOT feel good.

You've really put me in a bad position with several of the decisions that were made and I imagine I'm not the only one. This transition has been an overall nightmare for me. Hopefully it's gone better for others...",Negative

Being in banking myself (I worked for National Penn before the merger with KNBT) I know mergers don't always go as expected. I was giving the bank time to straighten out my issue, but what I was told today may be the last straw. I refinanced my mortgage with National Penn back in 2008. My payments were set to auto draft from my checking account every other Friday  (my paydays). The first payment after conversion pulled on Thursday instead of Friday causing an overdraft. I was able to get that fee refunded and was told they would correct the auto draft date. Wrong....next payment came out on Thursday. I called my branch this time and not the customer service number. She had my fee reversed and asked the mortgage dept to correct the auto draft day, showing them how it has always come out on Friday in the past. Mortgage comes back saying they cannot delay pulling the payment until Friday because it is actually due Thursday. Next option is to stop my auto draft so the branch requested them to do this. She called me today saying the Mortgage dept told her they can't stop the auto draft because it is in my documents saying I have to have autopay. WTF!!! I came home from work and looked at my copy of the documents. It says I can cancel my auto draft at anytime!!!! I will be talking to my branch again tomorrow and if this is not resolved, I will be closing my deposit accounts.

Now I am in an apartment that I cannot afford, in a hospital bed, and now I have been put on hospice. So there goes my dream of owning my own home with a little piece of land so I can feel the grass between my toes, and have some pretty flowers outside to attract butterflies and hummingbirds along with a lot of bird feeders! That way I can lay in  bed and watch all the beautiful things nature has to offer! All I get to see here is a big brick wall with a/c units running very loud outside.

With the OLD app, when you went to pick a date to send the payment, a calendar would appear. When you clicked on a date it would show you when the payment would arrive to the payment receiver. With the NEW app, this feature isn't available. Instead, you have to review your payment to see if it will be paid in two or five days. Then you have to cancel the payment, find a calendar, do the simple math, start the bill pay all over again and choose the preferred date.  It is very unfriendly. Because of this reason. I will be deleting this app and simply use a browser to log on BB&T to pay my bills since the calendar option is still available on your website. Even though I like the new app, this feature is very important. I've email BB&T four times about this. The first three emails were replied to saying the calendar option was there.

I don't have an iPhone, and hey had their own bbt app, why make the online banking an iPhone styled web app?  If I wanted that experience I buy an iPhone and download the app. The web portal is supposed to be for everyone.. It's almost impossible to pay a bill, and I can't see the entirety of the pop out menus.. Jesus, just give the the option to see a simple low-bandwidth no frills point an click..

1012027592210471_1013184498761447,2016-03-04T00:25:58+0000,"Very displeased and upset with BB&T banking after 7+ years of being a customer. This bank has stolen $1,380 from me and will not credit my account back (I have never called in to report a problem in the years before this incident). 

Beware of depositing cash in their ATM machines! I deposited $1,380 in 100s and 20s (dollar bills) on a Sunday evening (February 14th). The machine subsequently took the cash and then displayed an error message and gave me no receipt or acknowledgement of the deposit. No deposit activity was shown on the online banking either in the following days. The funds had just vanished. 

I reported the matter to the bank that same evening. 3 days later, a LaKeisha Brown finally got back to me and said an investigation would be opened and gave me a reference number (918969). She stated the matter could take up to 10 business days to resolve.

After 10 business days had passed (15 days altogether) and still hearing from nobody, I called back (today) only to be told that the bank was very busy with a merger and that they were still working on the case. I asked for an updated deadline but the customer service agent refused to provide one stating that “her boss told her she could no longer provide customers with anymore timeframe deadlines but that they were still working on it.”  

While I was still on the phone with this agent, I received a voicemail from LaKeisha Brown (from the same department) asking to call her back. Upon calling Ms. Brown back, she stated that the ATM in question had now been checked for the money and that nothing was found, and that the case would now be closed and that there was nothing else she could do to help.

Very odd how one minute a representative says the case is still being worked on and could take an indefinite amount of time to conclude and then a second later someone else calls and says they have the information they need and case closed.

I then followed up in person at the local BB&T branch where the deposit error occurred (8416 Arlington Blvd Fairfax, VA) and spoke to a manager there named Victor. I relayed to him all the information of everything that had happened. 

He was very puzzled after hearing everything and said he was not aware of anything that had happened at that branch until today (17 days after the incident). He also stated that he was unaware of anyone that had come by to check the ATM for the deposit error. Victor then said he would see what he could do to follow up with managers in the following days to see if anything else could be done.

If I do not get my $1380 returned to me by the end of this month (March) I will withdraw my remaining funds and close down the account. 

I understand banks have to protect themselves against fraudulent deposit claims---but in my case—this is ridiculous! I have been a customer for over 7 years and have never once troubled BB&T before over a deposit dispute claim. 

Why would I wait 7+ years and then all of sudden make up some false deposit claim????

Unbelievable!!!

Then you call and ask them to send a new one as quickly as possible and what do they say...""We can expedite this for 25 dollars or you can receive it in 10 days"". Honestly after banking with them since I was 17, I should move my banking to another entity because they are do not care about loyal customers. All they care about is saying sorry and then trying to get you to expand your service with them when they can't even get the other things right.

The only bank I have ever been told by a Vice President that if I didn't like their answer I should change banks....At the moment I am waiting for them to give me credit for a $10 bill that was torn and the ATM didn't like it cancelled my deposit and kept the bill . I went to BB&T the next morning thinking they would look in the ATM and either give me back my ten or credit my account.  No not BB&T I have to fill out some paper work and then they tell me in a day or 3 at the most when the ATM is serviced I will be contacted..  That was a week ago I have been to the bank twice since trying to get a answer and am told that the ATM division hasn't gotten back to them yet.  For one thing that is not acceptable to put a customer off with such a poor answer and another WHAT EXACTLY DOES THE ATM DIVISION DO IF IT DOESN'T SOLVE CUSTOMER PROBLEMS.  If BB&T was trying to establish itself in TX it has done the worst marketing job in the history of marketing.  The branch I used when it belonged to city was always busy, now I bet 10 people a day don't go there , it is more like a Ghost Bank than a real bank. The only good thing about the branch is the two tellers do their best to help you, but the upper management is hopeless.",Positive

Their reason was ""because my card was used around the general area as the disputed transaction"". Hahaha!! How stupid of a reason is that?! Do they think someone from China will steal my card info and then shop in Australia? If someone's card info is stolen it is very likely that it was stolen from a restaurant or store the BB&T customer frequents because they live in that area, so YES there would have been other legit purchases made- that in NO way means a fraudulent charge is not fraudulent! The fraudulent charge was for a T-Mobile purchase of over $300.  If BB&T would have sent an investigator to the store to check records & see which employee illegally ran my card without verifying my ID card, then BB&T would clearly see we did NOT make the purchase! Apparently I will have to go file a police report myself and track down who made the purchase which is simple enough if BB&T would have requested surveillance footage & the receipt for the transaction!!!

The teller Ms. Julie Singh refused to deposit my uncle's check because there is a word ""trust"" after his name. I tried to explain to her that we have been deposited this very same check every month for the last several years, no problem, I told her to check record and she acknowledged that same amount has been deposited to his account every month. I went to another branch, made a deposit for the same check, no question asked, go thru just like normal, every day transaction. I would like to know why ? why we are as BB&T account's holder could not make deposit in that branch ? Thank you",Positive

Even though I am in the process leaving your sorry excuse of a bank, I am still stuck using your institution, i have found it ridicules how long it take you guys to process transactions, you just want to get every penny of interest you can,  I have been using your outdated and unfriendly bill pay system to pay bills, as I did with Susquehanna Bank, if I schedule a bill pay on 12/21 and shows a payment date of 12/23 I would expect it to be paid on 12/23, but NO you processed it on 12/29 yet you debited the money from my account on 12/21 (this is just one example of three this month) therefore YOU are earning interest on my money while I am not, just another way you RIP OFF your clients, the more I see of your practices the more grateful I am that I have found a local bank to take my business to! Also your tellers at your former Susquehanna Branches need better training on your systems, when i closed one of my accounts out this past weekend it took two tellers and a manager over 30 minutes to figure out how to close my account and get me a check printed, all the while you have a line of customers backing up at the teller line and drive up.

When you post on here, ""Erica"" tells you to email them, which I have done and have not gotten one response to an email, again POOR customer service! The last time I called and spoke with a CSR they opened a case and I had told them I was only available by phone after 4 pm, they call at 2pm, again POOR customer service! I stopped by the Salem Avenue branch today to take change in only to find the coin machine out of service, when I asked the teller how long it would be out, she had no idea and said it had been broke for over 2 weeks, I asked if they could count the change, she handed me a bunch of coin wrappers and told me to bring it back warped... Susquehanna never did that, they would take it back and run it through their machine if the one in the lobby was not working, yet again POOR customer service! BB&T YOU ARE LOOSING MY BUSINESS!!!

Also, this branch was not open on Christmas Eve to get holiday money. It seems these two days would need ATM access as much or more than any other time of the year?

I know regulations require following rules and regulations but the pressure on employees is GREAT - a positive comment toward a coworker/child/teacher will help to create a more positive work place.

Missed my cash in the deposit at first (change).  Got my money right that he gave me back. Did reveral to add cash to my account.  Got home looked at my account had a question about reversal, called and the guy was like i gave you your cash( that was not the issue). I know i got my cash, just had a basic question about reversal, and would not answer the question i had (cause he did not have time according to him). I asked for a manager to answer my question and he told me he (cashier) was busy and got hung up on after he said he would put me on hold.  They only had one customer at the drive thru and one and the counter (me) when i was there as it was pouring down rain. I just dont think this guy knew what he was doing.  He was very stressful in how he dealt with the public as he made me apprehensive. I dont know if he was new but i had to call the bbt line to get my question answered.  If this guy cannot function with only two people to wait on, he needs time management skills or find a new career. this guy looked both professionally and personally a basketcase, and stressed out.  most stressful trip to the bank i ever took lol on top of that i forgot my calender!

Unfortunately, my mother was killed in a car accident in November and I'm trying to handle her affairs. Well, went into the branch with her death certificate and guess what, the banker that helped us ""forgot a step.""  Therefore, it is invalid.  So you mean to tell me that they can forget a step (payable on death was opened with no contact info for me) and not have to rectify the situation? Well, the banker I spoke to the other day told me, they are all ""human."" Just got disconnected with a consultant that stated in their research ""they"" "" cannot recall that part of the conversation.""  Of course that banker is not going to admit they messed up on something so sensitive and legal. So I asked,  but you can see they opened the payable on death account.  Don't you think that would have the person's contact information keyed in.  Heather's response was that ""maybe she was going to do that later.""  You must be kidding me?

I dealt with 3 Susquehanna Banks in my area, When I walked in the door someone always said, Hi Paul, or Good afternoon Paul. The point is they knew my name, not because I have alot of money but because I'm a person and not a number. These people knew me and my family and really cared about me. When a person trusts a bank with their money it's a big thing. At least it is to me. Now when I walk into a BB&T bank they yell out Welcome to BB&T... Where's the nicety to that? I do alot of internet banking as well. The Susquehanna Banks web site was the best. If I wanted to pay on my line of credit and just pay on the principal, it would let me do that, and it would up date immediately. But on this BB&T internet banking, I can't pay just on my line, my money goes right to the interest, and it takes up to 12 hours to update. When I was younger, I had 2 accounts at Leesport Bank, a personal account and a business account, I can still remember my banker saying to me, Paul, you don't work for your bank, Your bank works for you... If it wasn't for you the customer, I would be out of a job. It's to bad BB&T doesn't think that way. To be honest, I'm shopping for another bank. I'm looking for a ""small business"" Bank.

My current mortgage holder BB&T jumped in at the end and assured me if u stayed with them my refinance would go easier being they are my current company. Jennifer Veit was my contact at BBT Tequesta Fl. Branch. I was assured all the way through the process everything is fine then I get a call a couple days before closing by Jennifer and she states I need 4 k to make up for the incompetent ""cookie cutter"" appraisal , as she put it. I then stated this was not the deal , they had no problem taking my money for appraisal and keeping it and basically saying tough luck. Then all the sudden they wanted 6k at closing and came up w dates and deadlines in order to close their month. I am VERY DISSATISFIED and I want to warn anyone about dealing with these people and I will continue to be heard as $500 thrown in toilet is a waste, and I feel I was taken advantage of!!

Today's ordeal was a first for me and my granddaughter. It started when we arrived at BB&T location off El Dorado & Lake Forest. 

My granddaughter and I are members. I left work early so we could go to the bank to get a cashier's check to pay for her 1st car.

Upon arrival we found the bank closed at 5:00 PM as well the drive-thru. As we were driving around the building we saw the bank manager & a teller walking on the sidewalk. I asked if they could help me with my dilemma, at that time I explained to them we need to get a cashier's so we could to go to the dealer tonight with and make the final payment on her car. The bank manager explained there was nothing they could do & told us to call the 1-800 number for assistance. Duly noted, at that point I drove my truck to the front of the bank and preceded to call 1-800 number as instructed. 

As we were sitting in the parking lot we noticed the manager & teller was sitting in their vehicles watching us. They yelled out the car telling us to get off the bank's parking lot. We were not doing anything wrong so I ignored what they were saying. Shortly afterwards the Manager yelled if you don't leave the parking lot now she would call the police. I didn't understand what we're doing to make them want to call the police. I was shocked she threatening us for sitting in the parking lot doing what she suggested calling customer service. About 15 mins later. the Manager drove her truck and parked behind my vehicle yelling you need to leave this parking lot and I called police and they are on their way.  At that point I told her I am talking to a BB&T customer service agent. She drove her car back to her parking space and they sit there waiting on the police.  As they were waiting they were pointing at us & waving their hands.  I don't I ignored them.

I told the customer service agent what they were doing and she apologized for their actions. She offered to file a complaint on my behalf.  I told her It seems to us  are being racially profiled, harassed & threatened. Mind you we never exited our vehicle and posed no threat to them at anytime.

The McKinney Police Officer showed up, my blood pressure went up, I was afraid and nervous as to why she called the police. He got out his car and I explained to the Officer what we were doing & asked him what did they tell 911, he told 911 there was a disturbance happening in the parking lot. 

There were 3 reasons  why I was parked 1). I knew the call would take several minutes to get it resolved and it is was not safe to handle it while driving and 2). I have no a/c in my truck and to stay cool I parked my truck under the tree and 3). I didn't want to lose my cell phone signal.

I am 61 years old, a retiree from PepsiCo, a professional and was with my 19 year granddaughter. The only  reason why we suffered this embarrassing ordeal is because we were Black. We were in the broad open, not hiding or acting suspicious.

For the first time my granddaughter was subjected to racial profiling & the embarrassment of having someone make a frivolous accusation and get the police involved for no reason. It changed her perception about how evil and mean spirited people can all because of the color of our skin.

We were able to resolve the issue with the card, it took 37 minutes. The policeman was very polite, he came over to the truck asked what is happening. I told him the entire story,  he smiled and walked over to the 2 ladies & told them to leave the premise immediately. The Officer left and We stayed in front of the bank and proceeded to finish the transaction and filed a complaint.

If you ever you want to give your employees a gift please make sure they take diversity/sensitivity training. This could have turned into a nightmare. I thank God it didn't.

I will be seeking counsel on this issue. Racial profiling is dangerous and very wrong. It leaves massive damage in our communities. We thank God for sending a sensible Officer to your parking lot. 

Please call me at 214-457-8471 with questions/remarks/concerns.

Regards,

Joyce W. Johnson

I have been looking for a new bank but after the treatment today it won't be BB&T.  They don't seem to realize that treating people right gets you business, not the other way around.  Why do we let these banks do these things?  I've made several phone calls and I think we need legislation to make this illegal. I'm pushing my State Rep to make it happen.  It used to be illegal but the Feds changed the law and now its ok to charge you to get money that they guarantee is yours by their check.

BB&T keeps denying me because I haven't resolved my hardship, isn't that why I need a modification? So a couple of days ago I got another denial letter and then 4 days later I got another modification application from them while all this time they are racking up late fees, appraisal fees and other fees and then sending demand letters that I pay the $20, 000.00. A lawyer I hired for $2600.00 got me approved for a modification but BB&T says they never got my paperwork back. My husband and I both lost our full time jobs through no fault of our own, my job closed down and his job moved to Mexico.

When I received the 1st overdraft charge I went in and he supposedly corrected HIS error and reversed my charge.  I assumed all was well then 3 weeks or so later I received $500 in overdraft charges...No one in their ""corporate customer support"" office would help at all, said I had to go into the branch which I did.  They acknowledged that the error was theirs but the branch manager claimed she had to get approval from someone over her.  Two weeks go by and everytime I call the branch to talk to her she is ""busy"" and will call me back.  Of course she never does.

I talked to the manager and told her over the phone, that I wanted to open a savings account and deposit 130K, but I wanted the 870.25 in cash. The Mgr at first tried to give me a run around and said I would have to deposit all of it, and there would be a 2 week hold to verify the funds. I reminded her that this is 2015, not 1915, and a 2 minute phone call, or 30 seconds on her computer was all she needed. I dont want the bank to have free use of my money for 2 weeks. She put me on hold for a good while, and came back on and told me to come on in, that would be fine. When my wife and I arrived, the manager was out to lunch, and a 20 something girl named Jessica said she would help us. Once we got to her office, I inquired about depositing the money into 2 seperate accounts because FDIC only guarentees 100K. She told me Ishe couldnt split it up like that, and I could not access the money for 2 weeks. She refused to answer any of my questions, and told me my behavior was raising red flags. I asked, ""What behavior""? I'm just asking a question. I asked for the customer service number and she said, We dont have one. I asked where the main branch was, and she said, We dont have one. I asked for the phone number to the CEO of BB&T, and she said, I dont have that number.  Why wont you answer my question?, I asked.  She just kept saying, "" I'm not going to argue with you, I'll just tell you to have a nice day"". I replied, I'm not argueing with you, I just asked you a question. She said again, "" I'm not going to argue with you, Have a nice day"". We got up and started to leave, and as our backs were turned, she said in a nasty, sarcastic tone, "" Have a nice day"". In the parking lot, my wife turned to me and asked, ""Did we just get thrown out of that bank""? YUP !!! pretty much. Your bank truly sucks.

Any of this issues my wife and I ran into were our fault by not reading all the mailings we were sent and waited until our BoK cards didn't work before activating our BB&T cards.  Activating our cards took around 5 minutes total.  Licking our self-inflicted wounds.  If changing banks was as easy as everyone wants it to be that means your money isn't secure.

We could breakdown our transactions in our ""checking"" and could even free type who the check was for instead of just a ck number.

Wednesday I went to take money out of the ATM and the money didn't come out. So I called bb&t bc the branch couldn't do anything... I was told I had to wait until it hard posted to my account for them to be able to dispute it and reimburse me... Well after being on the phone for over an hour being bounced around to 5 different ppl I'm told Bb&t doesnt give provisional credits and that I have to wait 7-10 days for my claim to be processed.

It's not much, but they don't offer any incentive to leave my money with them to grow. Same for my savings accounts as well - AND you charge me to bank with you with a checking account regardless of my banking for almost for 10 years with this institution.

I'm obviously not the point of your focus as bank as a banker. You only want to make money off of your depositors in some way of an account we have with you or a fee. Not happy and I only pay to stay to bank with you for the tenure I have although I don't think it matters anymore today? 

I'm about to move all funds out soon. Not happy as a BB&T client anymore and it's upsetting when you have grown larger to have more locations for me.",Neutral

It was only 24 hours and it is my understanding that even yesterday there were clients who had their account fixed, it was a matter of time. What scares me is how unprepared we are as citizens and have no sense of emergency in case something happens, is it a lesson for BBT ?, I’m pretty sure it is , but it is also a lesson for us to make sure have a backup plan . What if there is a weather disaster, where there is no power to use a debit card, are we going to then blame the banks?.  I say let’s have a sense of tolerance and be mindful , there are people working to resolve this and they are no machines.

People need to be proactive when something happens. More than half of the commenters have complained about waiting on hold when the called the toll free number or not getting enough updates on Facebook. Well if any of those people had gotten off their butts and physically gone to the bank they would have had money for food, gas, etc. but they would rather sit around and complain and wait for someone else to rescue them.

When I finally got a hold of someone she never asked my name was really rude and said I don't know ur voice so I can't help u unless u come here. Of course I was mad so I had to leave work and I went to the other bank cuz I can't do rudeness today and guess what the lady never called me back and was with clients was standing speaking and laughing with the tellers.
